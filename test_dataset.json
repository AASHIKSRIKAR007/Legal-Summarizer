        "text": "the scope of the provisions for removal from register in terms of s 46 and 56 of the act stand on different footings. whereas s 46 had a limited application s 56 of the act is wider in nature. the act was enacted to provide for the registration and better protection of trademarks and for the prevention of the use of fraudulent marks of merchandise. registration of a trade mark remains valid for seven years. renewal applications are required to be filed on the expiry of seven years. m s jain industries got itself registered and obtained periodical renewal thereof as is required under the act. first respondent withdrew the application against m s jain industries. the prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps goods so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned. for the time being occurring in s 461b of the act two interpretations thereto which are possible are 1 the said words would denote non use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer and 2 the mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor. the registration of a trade mark confers a very valuable right. the person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner. it confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered. the same is an assignable right in terms of s 36 of the act whereas an unregistered trade mark is not. a registered proprietor of a trade mark should not be permitted to circumvent the law of user of the trade mark for a long time by assigning the same from time to time. but then such a case has to be made out. allegation of trafficking is a serious one. it must be proved in presence of the person against whom such allegations are made. at the time of grant of original registration advertisements are issued and objections are called for. renewal of registration in a sense also is not automatic. a person who had been using the said trade mark as a proprietor thereof by user is supposed to keep itself abreast with such applications filed by another either for registration of the trade mark or renewal thereof. the non user for a long time would disentitle a registered proprietor from renewal of the registration. s 461b provides for a special remedy. as a person obtains a right on and from the date of registration andor renewal thereof he can ordinarily be deprived of his right unless it is shown that the assignment thereof by his holder was not a bona fide one or had been made by way of camouflage. if the assignee has obtained assignment for bona fide use he may not be fastened with any liability owing to non user on the part of his predecessor. in other words the mistake of the predecessor should not be visited with non use of the present registered owner. in kabushiki kaisha toshiba v tosiba appliances co amp ors 2008 8 scale 354 2008 indlaw sc 1395this court held that they did not find any force in the aforementioned submission. cls a and b operate in different fields. sub s 3 covers a case falling within cl b and not the cl a thereof. had the intention of the parliament been that sub s 3 covers cases falling under cl b and clause ahaving regard to the similarity of the expressions used there was no reason as to why it could not be stated so explicitly. it was furthermore opined that there may be a case where owing to certain special circumstances a continuous use is not possible. the trade mark for which registration is obtained is used intermittently. such non user for a temporary period may be due to any exigency including a bar under a statute or a policy decision of the government or any action taken against the registrant. prima facie therefore appellant has been held to be the registered owner of the trade mark. it is one thing to say that for the purpose of frustrating an application for rectification the appellant had colluded with its predecessor for the purpose of trafficking by entering into the deed of assignment which is otherwise illegal and bad in law but it is another thing to say that the appellant could be proceeded against alone for non user of the registered trade mark for a period of more than five years. for the purpose of making out such a case both the original registrants as also the assignee were required to be impleaded as parties. the counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant did not state that it had waived its right so far as non impleadment of m s jain industries was concerned. it only consented for grant of liberty in favour of the first respondent for filing of an application for the self same cause of action. the question of maintainability of the second suit is absence of the registrant proprietor was not and could not have been the subject matter of consent at that stage. the cause of action which permitted the first respondent to file an application for rectification against m s jain industries was non user thereof by it. its non user and rectification of the register could not in the aforementioned situation have been tagged with the cause of action if any against the appellant. the right of a registered trade mark is not lost automatically on the expiry of five years and one month. it does not provide for a sun set law it has to be adjudicated upon. whether the registered proprietor of the trade mark had taken recourse to trafficking or not must be determined in an appropriate proceeding. the principle of purchaser of a property has a duty to make enquiriestherefore cannot apply in a case of this nature. so long as the right to assign a registered trade mark remains valid once the same is validly assigned the assignee derives the same right as that of the assignor in terms of the statute. a title to a trade mark derived on assignment as provided for under the act can not be equated with a defective title acquired in any other property as admittedly on the date of assignment the right of the registered trade mark was not extinguished. an assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses. if his title is not extinguished by reason of a provision of a statute for non user of the trade mark for a period of five years any assignment made shall be valid. the submission of mr sudhir chandra that the appellant was an infringer both of the right of m s jain industries as also the first respondent and thus its use was not bona fide in a case of this nature can not be accepted.",

the order passed by the arbitral tribunal holding that they did not have jurisdiction to entertain and try the claim and counter claim made by the parties.\nin order to appreciate the issue requiring determination a few relevant facts may be stated.\nthe appellant m s bharat petroleum corporation limited is a government of india undertaking under the administrative control of the ministry of petroleum natural gas and is engaged in refining distributing and selling of petroleum products all over the country.\nthe respondent m s great eastern shipping company limited is engaged in the business of shipping and allied activities and owns a fleet of tanker vessels for charter including the vessel known as jag praja.\nan agreement called the time charter party in legal parlance was entered into between the appellant and the respondent on 6th may1997 for letting on hire vessels for a period of two years from 22nd september1996 to 30th june1997 and from 1st july1997 to 30th june1998on the terms and conditions set out in the said agreement.\nhowever before the charter party was to come to an end on 29th june1998the indian oil corporation limited for short ioc acting as agent of the appellant issued a fax to various ship owners including the respondent herein requesting them to extend the validity of the charter party agreement dated 6th may1997 beyond 30th june1998 for a period of one month from 1st july1998 with option for two further extensions of 15 days each.\nthe respondent agreed to the said proposal.\naccordingly on 29th june1998 an addendum was signed between the parties whereby the validity period of charter party was extended for one month with an option for two further extensions for a period of 15 days each.\nthe terms and conditions exceptions and exemptions contained in the charter party dated 6th may1997 remained unaltered.\nthe parties are ad idem that the charter party dated 6th may1997 was extended till 31st august1998.\nit appears that since charter party dated 6th may1997 was coming to an end on 31st august1998the oil companies sought permission of the oil co ordination committee a wing of the ministry of petroleum and natural gas for further extension of the charter party.\nhowever the oil coordination committee by their fax message dated 26th august1998declined the request of the oil companies including the appellant for further extension of charter party beyond 31st august1998 the said fax message was an internal communication between the oil coordination committee and the oil companies.\nthereafter in september1998the ioc for and on behalf of the oil industry floated a fresh tender for carriage of petroleum products along the indian coast on time charter basis for a period of one year commencing from 1st september1998 to 31st august1999on the terms and conditions set out in the tender document.\nin response to the said tender the respondent and other vessel owners submitted their bids.\nit seems that being aggrieved of the decision of the ioc to invite revised price bids after opening of the sealed tenders one of the bidders filed a writ petition in the bombay high court questioning the said decision.\nthe appellant intervened in the said matter.\nthe writ petition was disposed of vide order dated 20th august1999 while disapproving in principle the action of the ioc in inviting fresh price bids after opening the bids but without recording final opinion on the merits of the issues raised in writ petition the court disposed of the petition inter alia directing that i the charter hire rates should be fixed by the tender evaluation committee and ii as the tender was for the period ending 31st august1999 and the writ petition was being decided on 20th august1999the ioc will not be required to enter into a contract for the period from 1st september1998 to 31st august1999 it is not in dispute that the vessel jag praja with which we are concerned continued to be chartered by the appellant till 31st august1999.\nit appears that pending finalization of a new charter party for the period commencing 1st september1998certain meetings took place between the oil companies and the ship owners including the respondent herein.\non 12th october1998the respondent informed the ioc that if all its nine vessels mentioned in the letter are used at a fair and reasonable rate for one year from 1st september1998 to 31st august1999 for which the tender had been floated they were agreeable to apply the new agreed rates for use of the said nine vessels from 1st july1998 on 31st october1998.\nthe ioc faxed to the respondent relevant portion of the message received by them from oil co ordination committee extending the period of usage of the existing coastal tanker fleet for the month of october1998at 80 charter hire rates prevailing till 30th june1998on provisional basis subject to adjustment of provisional charter hire with retrospective date from 1st september1998 against the revised charter hire to be finalised by the oil industry in response to the tender floated by ioc on 1st september1998 respondent s consent was asked for.\nthe respondent responded immediately vide their letter dated 5th november1998agreeing in principle that revised charter hire rates as and when finalized in response to tender floated by the ioc on 1st september1998would be applicable to the vessels which are selected under the tender retrospectively from 1st september1998 it was pointed out that the vessels which are not chartered under the tender floated would be at a disadvantage.\nit was clearly stated that since the tender was not finalized the owners will be guided by the existing terms and conditions.\nsome other objections not relevant at this stage were also indicated.\nas such all said and done oil co ordination committee s proposal was not accepted.\nnevertheless some suggestions to resolve the controversy were given.\nthus the proposal by the oil co ordination committee was not accepted by the respondent.\nin the alternative it was suggested by the respondent that the charter period be extended by six months on the existing terms and conditions at a mutually discussed time charter rate.\nadmittedly the vessels continued to be chartered by the appellant beyond the date of this letter.\nthereafter for almost two months there was no communication between the parties.\nit was only on 31st december1998 when the ioc issued a fax to the respondent enclosing draft letter regarding charter party agreement to be signed between the charterers and owners with minor modification if necessaryrequesting the respondent to sign as per proposal by the 4th january1999on which date the respondent expressed its disinclination stating in reply fax that as per usual practice pending finalization of new charter the existing terms and conditions of the charter party continue to apply.\nfinally it was suggested that we therefore suggest that we sign an agreement with you for the period from 1st september1998 until the matter is finally decided by you under the tender on the existing terms and conditions with the charter hire being provisionally paid on an ad hoc basis at 90 of the rate which was prevailing under the existing charter party.\nkindly confirm in order to draw up a suitable agreement accordingly.\nemphasis supplied.\nvide letter of even date i e 4th january1999the appellant suggested to the respondent that in the absence of a formal charter party with effect from 1st september1998a provisional arrangement for a period of four months effective from 1st september1998 with an option for extension of one month may be mutually agreed to by payment at the rate of 80 on charter hire prevailing on 30th june1998as ad hoc hire.\nthe respondent was asked to convey their acceptance to the said suggestion.\nit appears that the respondent did not respond to the said suggestion by the appellant but all the same its vessel continued to be on charter with the appellant.\nthe writ petition was ultimately disposed of on 20th august1999 it was only after a gap of about seven months that on 15th march2000the ioc informed the respondent about the evaluation of the tenders in terms of the order passed by the high court.\ncharter hire rate worked out by the committee for vessel jag praja for the period from 1st september1998 to 31st august1999 was communicated to the respondent.\nin response the respondent while expressing their disappointment with the rate but purportedly in view of their long business relations with the appellant conveyed their acceptance of the proposed rate in respect of each of the vessels named in separate letters all dated 1st.\nmay2000with the expectation that their outstanding balance of the hire shall be paid to them at the earliest.\nhowever the respondent did not convey their acceptance of the charter hire rates for two vessels viz.\njag praja and jag prayog.\nit appears that the respondent wrote various letters to the appellant for upward revision of the rate in respect of these two vessels but seemingly their request was ultimately turned down on 2nd november2000on receipt of which the respondent slammed a legal notice dated 6th november2000on the appellant inter alia requesting them to revise the rates on the basis of mutual discussions and settle the accounts.\nhaving failed to receive any reply to the said notice by another legal notice dated 1st december2000the respondent called upon the appellant to pay balance amount of rs 43947517 to them as charter hire in respect of vessel jag praja for the period from 1st september1998 to 31st august1999 within 15 days from date of receipt of the said notice or treat it as an arbitration notice.\nthe name of the arbitrator was also communicated to the appellant.\nit seems that pursuant to the said notice and some subsequent correspondence exchanged between the parties an arbitral tribunal was constituted.\nclaims and counter claims were filed before the arbitral tribunal.\non the basis of the pleadings of the parties the arbitral tribunal framed as many as eight issues.\nhowever arguments were heard only on the following three issues.\nissue no 1 whether the hon ble arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the dispute between the claimant and the respondent for the period september1998 to august1999.\nin respect of the vessel jag praja for the reasons stated in para 1 of the written statement.\nissue no 2 whether there is any common practice that if the vessel is not re delivered at the end of the period mentioned in the time charter the vessel would be governed by the charter party under which originally it was chartered.\nissue.\nno 5 whether the time charter party dated 6th.\nmay1997 came to an end by efflux of time on 30th august1998.\nvide order dated 12th.\nmay2003 the arbitral tribunal came to the conclusion that the appellant having invoked the arbitration clause contained in charter party agreement dated 6th may1997which was valid upto 31st august1998.\nand as the dispute between the parties related to the period subsequent to 31st.\naugust1998they had no jurisdiction to decide the reference.\nthe learned tribunal found issue no 2 in the negative and issue no 5 in the affirmative.\naccording to the tribunal on and after 1st september1998charter party agreement dated 6th may1997 was superseded by a fresh agreement and a term of the agreement was that the charter hire rate would be determined by the oil co ordination committee of the ioc in nutshell the tribunal was of the view that with the performance original charter party dated 6th may1997 got extinguished.\nthe respondent challenged the said award before the high court.\nby the impugned order the learned single judge has set aside the said award inter alia holding that arbitral tribunal has the jurisdiction to adjudicate the disputes between the parties as the vessel continued to be hired by the appellant for the period subsequent to 31st august1998 on the same terms and conditions as were contained in the charter party dated 6th may1997only subject to the revision or modification of the rate of hire to be determined by the oil co ordination committee.\nthe learned judge also felt that the tribunal had erred in totally excluding from its consideration cls 23 and 4 1 of the charter party dated 6th may1997whereunder the charter party was to come to an end on re delivery of the vessel.\nadmittedly after 31st august1998re delivery of vessel did not take place and therefore in terms of clause 23the vessel continued to be hired on the same terms and conditions except the term as to the hire charges on which there was disagreement between the parties.\nit was thus held that the charter party dated 6th may1997 did not come to an end by efflux of time and it was extended by the parties on the same terms and conditions except the rate of hire.\ncorrectness of this order of the high court is questioned in this appeal.\nmr sudhir chandra learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has assailed the impugned order on the sole ground that the charter party dated 6th may1997 having come to an end by efflux of time on 31st august1998the arbitration clause contained in it also perished and therefore in the absence of a fresh arbitration agreement claim of the respondent relating to the period 1st september1998 to 31st august1999 could not be referred to arbitration by invoking arbitration clause in charter party dated 6th may1997 laying emphasis on the fax message dated 26th august1998 addressed by the oil co ordination committee to the oil companies including the appellant inter alia informing them that no further extension of the current charter hire rate will be allowed learned counsel submitted that the said message made it clear to all concerned that charter party dated 6th may1997 would not be extended under any circumstance.\nshyam divan learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent on the other hand submitted that notwithstanding the fact that the period fixed originally under the charter party or under the addendum dated 29th june1998 had come to an end the subsequent conduct of the parties goes to show that charter of the vessel by the appellant beyond 31st august1998 continued to be governed by the terms and conditions stipulated in charter party dated 6th may1997 and therefore an arbitration agreement did exist between the parties.\nlearned counsel argued that even otherwise till the vessel was not re delivered in terms of cls 4 and 23 of charter party dated 6th may1997the said agreement could not come to an end.\nit was pointed out that all the obligations of the owners as well as of the charterers during the period the vessel was in use continued to be discharged under the charter party dated 6th may1997 even after the expiry of the period of the charter party.\nin support of the proposition that the concurrence of a party can be gathered from his conduct like continued user of the vessel in the present case without any objection to respondent s letter dated 4th january1999reliance is placed on a decision of this court in the godhra electricity co ltd anr.\nthe state of gujarat anr 1974 indlaw sc 253.\nit was also submitted that the view taken by the high court being a plausible view interference in exercise of extra ordinary jurisdiction u art 136 of the constitution is unwarranted.\nthus the short question for determination is whether on the expiry of the extended period of charter hire on 31st august1998charter party dated 6th may1997 came to an end and the arbitration agreement between the parties perished with it.\nbefore we proceed to examine the rival stands we may note at the outset that neither the arbitral tribunal nor the high court have gone into the question whether the claim made by the respondent would otherwise fall within the ambit of the arbitration clause in the charter party or not.\nwhat is in dispute is whether the arbitration agreement between the parties had got extinguished after 31st august1998i e the date of expiry of the extended period of the charter party.\ntherefore we refrain from expressing any opinion on the scope and ambit of the arbitration clause though prime facie it appears to be quite widely worded.\nit is no doubt true that the general rule is that an offer is not accepted by mere silence on the part of the offerree yet it does not mean that an acceptance always has to be given in so many words.\nunder certain circumstances offerree s silence coupled with his conduct which takes the form of a positive act may constitute an acceptance an agreement sub silentio.\ntherefore the terms of a contract between the parties can be proved not only by their words but also by their conduct.\nin our view the principle of sub silentio is clearly attracted in the present case.\nas noted above after the extended period of charter party dated 6th may1997 had come to an end on 31st august1998.\nand the bids received pursuant to fresh invitation were pending finalization vide their letter dated 12th.\noctober1998the respondent had informed the appellant that they were agreeable to apply new rates for use of the vessel from 1st july1998 provided all the nine vessels are used.\nhowever on 31st october1998the appellant faxed ioc s message informing them of the extension of the existing coastal tanker fleet for the month of october1998 at reduced rates viz 80 of the charter party rates prevailing till 30th august1998 on receipt of the said letter the respondent vide their letter dated 5th november1998protested against the revision of the rates for the vessel not being considered under the new bid and stated in unequivocal terms that it was not possible for them to accept the proposal of the oil co ordination committee communicated to them vide letter dated 12th.\noctober1998 yet again while responding to appellant s fax dated 31st december1998whereby the respondent was required to sign a provisional charter party by 4th january1999vide their letter dated 4th january1999the respondent pointed out to the appellant that usual practice is that pending finalization of the new charter the existing terms and conditions of the charter party continue to apply and therefore they were willing to sign the agreement as contemplated by the appellant based on the existing terms and conditions.\nit was suggested that an agreement may be signed between them for the period from 1st september1998 until the matter was finally decided by the appellant under the tender on the existing terms and conditions with the charter hire being provisionally paid on ad hoc basis at 90 of the rate which was prevailing under the existing charter party.\nas noted hereinabove there was no response by the appellant to respondent s letter dated 4th january1999 though it appears that vide their letter of even date the appellant did suggest to the respondent that as a token of formal agreement the said letter may be jointly signed by the charterers and the vessel owners.\nadmittedly no such agreement was signed between the parties.\nindubitably there was no further exchange of correspondence between the parties during the year.\nnevertheless the appellant continued to use the vessel on hire with them under the time charter dated 6th may1997 the conduct of the parties as evidenced in the said correspondence and in particular appellant s silence on respondent s letters dated 5th november1998 and 4th.\njanuary1999coupled with the fact that they continued to use the vessel manifestly goes to show that except for the charter rate there was no other dispute between the parties.\nthey accepted the stand of the respondent sub silentio and thus continued to bind themselves by other terms and conditions contained in the charter party dated 6th may1997which obviously included the arbitration clause.\nwe may examine the issue from another angle based on respondent s stand that charter party dated 6th may1997 continues to be in vogue till the chartered vessel is re delivered.\nin this context it would be appropriate to refer to cls 4 and 23 of the charter party dated 6th may1997 these are in the following terms 4 delivery redelivery 4 1.\nthe vessel shall continue to be on charter to charterers in direct continuation from 2348 hrs 22 09 1996 to 30 06 1998 the vessel shall be re delivered by charterers to owners on dropping last outward pilot at any port on west coast of india at charterers option.\ncharterers to give owners 15 days notice to probable port of re delivery.\n4 2 charterers to load last three cargoes clean and re deliver the vessel in clean condition.\nfinal voyage should the vessel be on her voyage towards the port of redelivery at the time of payment of hire is due payment of hire shall be made for such length of time as owners and charterers may agree upon as being estimated time necessary to complete the voyage less any disbursements made or expected to be made or expenses incurred or expected to be incurred by charterers for owners account and less the estimated amount of bunker fuel remaining at the termination of the voyage and when the vessel is redelivered any overpayment shall be refunded by the owners or underpayment paid by charterers.\nnotwithstanding the provisions of cl 4 hereof should the vessel be upon voyage at the expiry of the period of this charter charterers shall have the use of vessel at the same rate and conditions for such extended time as may be necessary for the completion of the round voyage on which she is engaged and her return to a port of redelivery as provided by the charter.\non a conjoint reading of the said clauses it is plain that the appellant was under an obligation to re deliver the vessel as per the procedure contemplated in the afore noted clauses.\nindisputably the vessel in question had not been re delivered at least during the relevant period and the appellant continued to use the vessel beyond 31st august1998 having failed to re deliver the vessel in terms of cl 4 1 of the charter party the appellant can not plead that the charter party had been fully worked out.\nit is clear from the pleadings and issue no 2framed by the arbitral tribunal that it was respondent s consistent stand that since the hired vessel had not been re delivered at the end of the time charter party the vessel would be governed by the terms and conditions in the charter party dated 6th may1997.\nhowever the arbitral tribunal answered the said issue against the respondent.\nit appears to us that even the question in regard to the effect and consequences of non delivery of the vessel in terms of the cl 4 1 and 23 would by itself be a dispute arising under the said charter party with.\nrespect.\nthe learned arbitral tribunal overlooked this aspect of the matter.\nwe are therefore of the opinion that though performance of the charter party agreement dated 6th may1997 may have come to an end on 31st august1998.\nbut it was still in existence for some purposes viz the effect of vessel s non re delivery as per the prescribed mechanism and its continued use beyond the stipulated time.\nand thus the arbitration clause in the said charter party operated in respect of these and other allied purposes.\ntherefore the factual scenario in the instant case leads to an inescapable conclusion that notwithstanding the expiry of the period fixed in the time charter party dated 6th may1997the said charter party did not get extinguished inter alia for the purpose of determination of the disputes arising thereunder and the arbitration clause contained therein could be invoked by the respondent.\nin view of the foregoing discussion we do not find any infirmity in the view taken by the high court that charter party dated 6th may1997 had not come to an end by efflux of time and it got extended by the conduct of the parties warranting interference.\nhaving come to the conclusion that an arbitration agreement existed between the parties the question which remains to be considered is whether the disputes between the parties should be referred to the same arbitral tribunal which had come to the conclusion that in the absence of any arbitration agreement it did not have jurisdiction to entertain and try the claims and counter claims.\nwe feel that it would be proper and expedient to constitute a fresh arbitral tribunal.\naccordingly we constitute an arbitral tribunal consisting of justice m jagannadha rao presiding arbitratorjustice d p wadhwa and justice s n variava former judges of this court to adjudicate upon the claim counter claim by the parties subject to their consent and such terms and conditions as they may deem fit and proper.\nit goes without saying that the learned tribunal shall deal with the matter uninfluenced by any observations in this order on the respective stands of the parties.\nresultantly the appeal being devoid of any merit is liable to be dismissed which we do leaving the parties to bear their own costs.\nthe registry is directed to communicate this order to the learned members of the arbitral tribunal to enable them to enter upon the reference and decide the matter as expeditiously as practicable.\nappeal dismissed.",

act1947.\nhereinafter called the rent act is the question involved in this appeal by special leave from the judgment and order of the high court of gujarat dated 21st of august1979.\nin order to decide this question it is necessary to decide the scope and ambit of section 292 of the rent act.\nto decide this facts must be referred to.\nthe appellant claimed to be the tenant in respect of the two premises which are quite adjacent to each other one of which is involved in this appeal.\nthe respondent is the landlord of the two premises and these were situated at raikhad ward ahmedabad.\nthe respondent had alleged in the two suits that the appellant was his tenant in the suit premises which were leased out to him and before him his father for conducting the business in the name of ahmedabad fine.\nweaving works and according to the terms of tenancy suit premises were leased for manufacturing cloth in the name of ahmedabad fine.\nweaving works.\nthe respondent had further alleged that the appellant no 1 had closed the business and he was not using the said premises for the purpose for which it was let to him.\nit was the case of the appellant that in respect of the suit premises he was carrying on his business with respondents.\nnos 24 and 5 in the name of respondent no 2m s.\nbharat neon signs hereinafter referred to as respondent no 2.\nwe are concerned in this appeal with only one of the premises which was involved in suit no 553 of 1969 it is not in dispute and it never was that the premises was being used by bharat neon signs firm being the defendant no 2 in the original suit.\nat the time of the institution of the suit the defendants nos 2 to 5 were admittedly the partners.\nthe present appellant who was the original defendant no 1 claimed to be a partner.\nthe main controversy was whether the appellant had sublet the premises to defendant no 2bharat neon signs or whether he being a partner of the said firm had permitted the said firm to use the premises in question.\nit is clear from the evidence on record that the partnership firm had undergone metamorphosis from time to time and again ever since the year 1960 the firm bharat neon signs first originated on 4th of october1960 as many as six persons were named in the partnership firm on or about 4th of october1960 and they had executed a deed of partnership on 13th of october1960 which is exhibit 114 on the record.\nthe said partnership deed records six persons who were to run the business in manufacturing and selling bharat neon signs tubes.\nhowever the document is silent as to where the business was started.\non or about 24th of october1960.\nanother partnership deed being exhibit 69 came to be executed among the six persons and the father of the appellant girdharlal.\nthe document is exhibit 69 and is signed by the father of the appellant and the appellant himself also.\nit may be mentioned that the partnership deed exhibit 114 was executed by six persons and at that stage the appellant or his father were not partners in the firm.\nbut thereafter when the partnership deed exhibit 69 was executed the appellant and his father joined the firm with an agreement to share profits only and their share was fixed at 0 03 paise in a rupee.\nthere is a third partnership deed exhibit 70 which showed that the deceased tenant girdharlal had died on 1st of february1961 and so by the remaining seven partners with same terms and conditions a new partnership deed being exhibit 70 was executed on 22nd.\nseptember1961 at this time the share of the appellant was fixed at 0 03 paise in a rupee to share the profits only.\nin 1965 some partners retired and the remaining four partners executed a fresh partnership deed exhibit 117 on 1st.\napril1965 this last partnership deed was executed by the appellant and original defendants.\nnos 34 and 5.\nthe main question in issue in this appeal as well as before the high court in revision was whether there was a genuine partnership at the appellant was a partner.\nit is true that since after 4th of october1960 the partnership firm was carrying on business in the premises in question.\nit is well settled that if there was such a partnership firm of which the appellant was a partner as a tenant the same would not amount to subletting leading to the forfeiture of the tenancy.\nfor this proposition see the decision of the gujarat high court in the case of mehta jagjivan vanechand v doshi vanechand harakhchand and others.\na i r 1972 gujarat 6 1970 indlaw guj 68 thakkar j of the gujarat high court as the learned judge then was held that the mere fact that a tenant entered into a partnership and allowed the premises being used for the benefit of partnership does not constitute assignment or subletting in favour of the partnership firm entitling a landlord to recover possession.\nthis view is now concluded by the decision of this court in madras bangalore transport co west v inder singh and others1986 3 s c c 62 1986.\nindlaw sc 748.\nthe trial court in the instant appeal held that there was subletting.\nit accordingly decreed the suit for possession instituted by the landlord.\nthe suit inter alia was filed by the landlord on the ground of subletting.\nthere was an appeal before the court of small causes bombay and by judgment and order delivered by the court of small causes bombay on 18th of august1977it was held that the learned trial judge had erred in passing a decree for possession on the ground of subletting change of user and breach of terms of tenancy.\nin the premises the appeal was allowed.\nit may be mentioned that the respondent no 1 is the landlord of two premises which were quite adjacent as mentioned before.\nthe respondent plaintiff had alleged in both the suits that the appellant was his tenant in the suit premises which were leased to him for conducting his business in the name of ahmedabad fine.\nweaving works and according to the terms of tenancy suit the suit premises were leased for manufacturing cloth in the name of ahmedabad fine weaving works.\nthe landlord had alleged that the appellant had closed that business and he was not using the premises in question for the purpose for which it was let to him.\nit was further alleged by the landlord that the appellant had unlawfully sublet the major part of the premises in question of both the suits to defendant nos 2 to 5 in the original suit and these defendants were running business in partnership for manufacturing of neon signs in the name of bharat neon signs.\nit was further alleged that the appellant had also unlawfully sublet one room of the suit premises to defendant no 6 in suit no 553 of 1969 who was residing in that room.\nfor the purpose of the suit no 553 of 1969 with which the appeal is concerned it is relevant to state that the appellant had raised the contention that ahmedabad fine weaving works was not the tenant of the suit premies but the suit premises was tenanted by the father of the appellant girdharlal chimalal in 1938 and he was the original tenant of the premises and appellant subsequently joined the business of his father as a partner and the name of the partnership firm was ahmedabad fine weaving works.\nhe has stated further that the suit premises were to be used for business and he could use it for any business and he joined in partnership with defendants nos 2 to 5 somewhere in 1961 to prepare neon signs and the defendants nos 2 to 5 were his partners and doing business in the suit premises.\nhe contended further that the suit premises was with him and the defendants nos 2 to 5 had not acquired any tenancy rights in the suit premises.\nit is further stated that he had filed a civil suit to dissolve the partnership and to take account and his suit was pending in city civil court.\nit may be mentioned that by the time the revision petition came to be decided by the high court the suit had been decreed in his favour directing a dissolution of the said partnership and directing taking of the accounts.\nthere was an appeal filed from that decree and that appeal was also dismissed and disposed of affirming the decree for the dissolution of the partnership inter se between the parties being the partners of the said firm.\nthese facts were accepted that there was a partnership.\nas mentioned hereinbefore the learned trial judge consolidated both the suits and in the instant suit being no 553 of 1969 with which this appeal is concerned it was held by the learned trial judge that there was unlawful subletting.\nthere was a decree for possession.\nthis was set aside in appeal.\nthe appellate court so far as the material for the present appeal is concerned held that there was no subletting and there was only carrying on of the business in partnership with defendants nos 2 to 5 in the name of bharat neon signs.\ntherefore the first question that had to be decided by the appellate court being the court of small causes bombay and if a revision lay before the high court was whether there was any genuine partnership.\nthe partnership deeds were there the appellant was not to share in the losses.\nthe court of small causes came to the conclusion on an analysis of the evidence before it and the terms of the three partnership deeds referred to hereinbefore that there was a genuine partnership in law which was acted upon.\nthe high court in revision reversed that finding.\nthe first question therefore is whether the high court could do so in the facts of this case and secondly whether the high court was right in so doing.\nwhether there was a partnership or not may in certain cases be a mixed question of law and fact in the sense that whether the ingredients of partnership as embodied in the law of partnership were there in a particular case or not must be judged in the light of the principles applicable to partnership.\nthe first question therefore is what is a partnership.\nthat has to be found in section 4 of the indian partnership act1932it says partnership is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all emphasis supplied.\nsection 6 of the said act reiterates that in determining whether a group of persons is or is not a firm or whether a person is or is not a partner in a firm regard shall be had to the real relation between the parties as shown by all relevant facts taken together.\nthe following important elements must be there in order to establish partnership1 there must be an agreement entered into by all parties concerned2.\nthe agreement must be to share profits of business and 3 the business must be carried on by all or any of the persons concerned acting for all.\nthe partnership deeds were there entitling the petitioner to share in the partnership.\nit is true that in the partnership deeds the bank accounts were not to be operated by the appellant and further that irrespective of the profit.\nthe clause of the partnership deed provided that there should be a fixed percentage of profit to be given to the partner appellant no 1 the appellant was not to share the losses.\nbut there is nothing illegal about it.\nthe appellant was to bring his asset being the tenancy of the premises in question for the user of the partnership.\nall these tests were borne in mind by the court of small causes bombay in the appeal from the decision of the learned trial judge.\nthe appellate court had considered the partnership deeds.\none point was emphasised by mr mehta learned counsel appearing for the respondents that the original first partnership deed did not mention the appellant or his father as a partner.\nit was in the second partnership deed that the appellant and his father joined the firm.\nthe firm started as emphasised by mr mehta on 4th of october1960 and it was only on the 24th of october1960 the second partnership deed was executed.\ntherefore it was emphasised that there was a gap of time when there was user by the partnership firm of the premises in question when the appellant was not a member of the firm.\nit was emphasised that this aspect was not considered by the court of small causes and the high court therefore was justified in interfering with the findings of the court of small causes.\nwe are unable to agree.\nthese deeds were there the partners were crossexamined there was no specific evidence as to from what date the firm started functioning from the particular premises in question.\nsecondly it was emphasised by mr mehta that the partnership deed was a camouflage.\nit is evident from the sales tax registration and other registration certificates and licences under the shops and establishments act that the partnership was registered in the name of the appellant and the appellant was also indicated as a partner.\nit was so in the income tax returns and assessments.\ntherefore it was submitted that the court of small causes committed an error of law resulting in miscarriage of justice.\nit was submitted by mr mehta that once it was accepted that the partnership deed was a mere camouflage the other subsequent acts and conducts were merely ancillary and were put in a formal way.\nbut the question is from the three deeds itself which were examined in detail by the court of small causes and which were re examined by the high court could it be said unequivocally that there was no partnership.\nthe deeds gave the appellant the right to share the profits and made him agent for certain limited purposes of the firm and there was evidence that the partnership deeds were acted upon.\nthere was evidence of suit of dissolution of the partnership where none of the partners took the plea that it was a false or a fictitious document.\nthough the decree in the dissolution suit was not binding in these proceedings inter se between the parties as partners it is a piece of evidence which can not be wholly ignored.\nall these factors were present before the court of small causes.\nthese were reappraised by the high court.\nmehta.\nthat in the partnership deed which is not necessary to recite the terms the petitioner was completely excluded in operating the bank accounts etc.\nthere is nothing inherently illegal or improbable making a provision of such a type.\nin the eye of law such a clause is really non sequitur or neutral proving neither the existence nor non existence of a genuine firm.\nthe first partnership deed which is exhibit 114 is dated 13th october1960 it recited that the partnership firm should be presently started at ahmedabad and the same should later be started in another city.\nin this the appellant was not a partner.\nexhibit 69 at page 136 of volume ii of the paper book is a partnership deed wherein girdharlal the father of the appellant no 1 and the appellant no 1 joined as partners.\nit recited that the partnership started from 4th of october1960 at ahmedabad.\nit was registered in the name of 7th and 8th partners girdharlal who was the appellant and his father.\nit was recited that the work of the partnership would be done by the parties of the fourth fifth sixth seventh and eighth as per advice and instructions of the first second and third.\nall the work had been done by some of the partners of which appellants were not parties and that they had to do the said work as per instructions of the other partners.\nclauses 6 and 7 of the said partnership deed recited inter alia as follows 6 the year of accounts of our partnership shall be aso vadi 30th day i e diwali and the first account year is decided to be the aso vadi 30th day of samvat year 2017 while settling accounts at the close of the year33 amount from the sum which may remain as net profit after deducting all expenditures viz interest discount rent of the shop rent of the godown insurance brokerage travelling telegrams postage salaries of employees etc shall be carried to reserve fund and thereafter in the sum that remains as net profit the shares of us the partners have been fixed as under 7 while settling accounts at the close of the year if the sum less than rs 1500 falls to the 0 03 shares of the partners of the seventh and eighth parts the amount falling short has to be debited towards the head of expenditure and rs 1500 fifteen hundred only have to be paid in full to each of them two and in those circumstances or if there be loss the parties of the seventh or eighth parts have not been held liable therefore and in the year or losses it has been decided to pay rs 1500 fifteen hundred only to each of them after debiting the same towards the head of expenditure and in the year of losses nothing has to be carried to the reserve fund and the loss has to be borne by us to parties first to sixth parts in the following proportion 8 clause 8 empowered the operating of the bank accounts by partners other than the appellant and his father.\nwe find intrinsically nothing improbable.\nit is embodied in the deeds the functioning of the partnership.\nthe third partnership which is dated 22nd of september1961 also indicates as parties of sixth part the name of the appellant.\nthe relevant portion of the partnership deed reads as follows to wit the parties of the first to sixth parts out of us deceased khristi girdharbhai chimanlal and shah virchand keshavji had jointly started the business of manufacturing and selling neon signs tubes in partnership in ahmedabad from 4 10 1960in the name and style of bharat neon signs.\nhowever on account of the death of khristi girdharbhai chimanlal on 1 2 61 and other reasons the said partnership was dissolved from 8 9 61 thereafter we the parties from the first to seventh part have after purchasing at its cost price all the debts and dues goods stock etc together with goodwill of the dissolved partnership started manufacturing and selling of neon signs tubes in partnership from 9 9 61 we the parties of all the seven parts execute the deed of the said partnership to day.\ni e 22 9 61 the terms and conditions.\nthereof are as under.\n1 the entire work of our partnership has to be carried out in the name of bharat neon signs.\n2 the work to be carried out by our partnership is of manufacturing and selling neon signs tubes and of obtaining orders therefore.\n3 whatever moneys that may be required to be invested in our partnership are to be invested by the parties of the first second third fourth and seventh parts out of us and the interest at the rate of 712 per cent per annum has to be paid for the moneys that may be invested in this partnership.\nwe are of the opinion that these were evidence that these terms were acted upon.\nthere was nothing intrinsically wrong in law in constituting a partnership in the manner it was done.\nit was contended by mr mehta that there was no agency reading the partnership deeds as we have read that conclusion does not emanate from position appearing debiting the fixed amount payable to the appellant in the expenses account which also is not inconsistent with partnership.\nthis is also not inconsistent with treating the rent of the firm in the context of the total expenditure of the firm.\nin any event all these factors were considered by the court of small causes bearing in mind the correct legal principles.\nthe high court on a reappraisal of these very evidence came to the conclusion that the partnerships were camouflages and were not acted upon and in fact and in reality the partnership firm was a sub tenant of the appellant herein.\nthe question is can the high court do so in law.\nthe power of the high court to revise the order is contained in section 292 of the bombay rent act as applicable at the relevant time to gujarat the said provision reads as follows 292.\nno further appeal shall lie against any decision in appeal under sub section 1 but the high court may for the purpose of satisfying itself that any such decision in appeal was according to law call for the case in which such decision was taken and pass such order with respect thereto as it thinks fit.\nthe ambit and power of revision generally and in particular with respect to the provisions with which we are concerned have from time to time come up for consideration by this court.\nthis court in hari shankar v rao girdhari lal chowdhury1962 1 suppl.\nscr 933 1961 indlaw sc 157 had to consider section 351 of the delhi ajmer rent corntrol act1952.\nthe said section reads as follows 351.\nthe high court may at any time call for the record of any case under this act for the purpose of satisfying itself that a decision made therein is according to law and may pass such order in relation thereto as it thinks fit.\nit was held in the majority judgment by hidayatuiiah j as the learned chief justice then was that though section 35 of the delhi and ajmer rent control act was worded in general terms but it did not create a right to have the case re heard.\nthis court emphasised that the distinction between an appeal and revision is a real one.\na right to appeal carries with it right of re heating on law as well as fact.\nunless the statute conferring the right to appeal limits the re hearing in some way.\nthe power to hear a revision is generally given to a superior court so that it may satisfy itself that a particular case is decided according to law.\nthe expression according to law in section 35 of the said act referred to the decision as a whole and was not to be equated to errors of law or of fact simpliciter.\nthis court was of the view that what the high court could see is that there has been no miscarriage of justice and that the decision was according to law in the sense mentioned.\nkapur j who delivered a separate judgment however observed that the power under section 351 of the said act of interference by the high court is not restricted to a proper trial according to law or error in regard to onus of proof or proper opportunity of being heard.\nit is very much wider than that when in the opinion of the high court the decision is erroneous on the question of law which affects the merits of the case or decision was manifestly unjust the high court is entitled to interfere.\nthe revisional authority could ensure that there was no miscarriage of justice and the principles of law have been correctly borne in mind the facts had been properly comprehended in that light.\nif that was done in a particular case then the fact that the revisional authority or the high court might have arrived to a different conclusion is irrelevant.\nthis view had also been expressed in the decision of this court in puranchand v motilal1963.\nsupp 2 s c r 906 1962 indlaw sc 455.\nthis principle was reiterated in krishnawati v hans raj1974 2 s c r 524 1973 indlaw sc 208 which was dealing with section 392 of the delhi rent control act1958 in second appeal.\nit was observed that under section 392 of the said act the high court could interfere in second appeal only if there was a substantial question of law.\nin that case the question whether the appellant was legally married no finding was necessary in the eviction suit.\nit was sufficient for the rent court to proceed on the finding that the appellant and s were living together as husband and wife whether they were legally married or not.\nit was further held that whether there was subletting was not a mixed question of law and fact.\nin phiroze bamanji desai v chandrakant m patel ors 1974 3 scr 267 1974 indlaw sc 282 the question involved was whether there was reasonable and bona fide requirement of premises for personal use and occupation as also the question of greater hardship under the bombay rent act and the ambit and scope of the power of section 293 of the said act with which we are concerned came up for consideration.\nbhagwati j as.\nthe learned chief justice then was referred with approval the observations of hidayatullah j referred to hereinbefore in hari shankar 's case.\n1961 indlaw sc 157 supra bhagwati j observed that the ambit of section 351 of the delhi ajmer rent control act which fell for consideration in hari shanker 's case 1961 indlaw sc 157 supra was the same as section 293 of the bombay rent act and therefore he expressed the opinion that the high court could interfere only if there was miscarriage of justice due to mistake of law.\nwe must take note of a decision in the case of m s kasturbhai ramchand panchal brothers and others v firm of mohanlal nathubhai and others air 1969 gujarat 110 1967 indlaw guj 57upon which the high court had placed great reliance in the judgment under appeal.\nthere the learned judge relying on section 292 of the said act held that the revisional power with which the high court was vested under section 292 was not merely in the nature of jurisdictional control.\nit extended to corrections of all errors which would make the decision contrary to law.\nthe legislature the learned judge felt further empowered high court in its revisional jurisdiction to pass such order with respect thereto as it thought fit.\nthe power according to the learned judge was of the widest amplitude to pass such orders as the court thought fit in order to do complete justice.\nhe dealt with the human problem under section 132 of bombay rent act considering the relative hardships of the landlord and the tenant and to arrive at a just solution he was of the opinion that the court should have such wide field.\nthe jurisdiction of high court is to correct all errors of law going to the root of the decision which would in such cases include even perverse findings of facts perverse in the sense that no reasonable person acting judicially and properly instructed in the relevant law could arrive at such a finding on the evidence on the record.\nin this view in our opinion the ambit of the power was expressed in rather wide amplitude.\nas we read the power the high court must ensure that the principles of law have been correctly borne in mind.\nsecondly the facts have been properly appreciated and a decision arrived at taking all material and relevant facts in mind.\nit must be such a decision which no reasonable man could have arrived at.\nlastly such a decision does not lead to a miscarriage of justice.\nwe must however guard ourselves against permitting in the guise of revision substitution of one view where two views are possible and the court of small causes has taken a particular view.\nif a possible view has been taken the high court would be exceeding its jurisdiction to substitute its own view with that the courts below because it considers it to be a better view.\nthe fact that the high court would have taken a different view is wholly irrelevant.\njudged by that standard we are of the opinion that the high court in this case had exceeded its jurisdiction.\nin the case of punamchandra revashankar joshi v ramjibhai maganlal gujarat law reporter.\n1966the gujarat high court after dealing with the gujarat amendment act xviii of 1965 observed that the legislature has not intended to equate the ambit of the power with the one exercised in an appeal.\nthe authority vested in the high court under the amendment still remained only in the domain of the jurisdiction and power of revision and no further.\nthe amending provision therefore only related to procedure and not to any rights of the parties.\nthis court in the case of bhai chand ratanshi v laxmishanker tribhavan1982 1 rent control journal 2421981.\nindlaw sc 244 observed that where lower courts applied their minds properly in deciding a matter under section 132 of the bombay rent act the high court could not substitute its own finding for the one reached by the courts below on a reappraisal of evidence under section 292 of the act as substituted by the gujarat act 18 of 1965 this court reiterated that although the high court had wider power than that which could be exercised under section 115 of c p c yet its revisional power could only be exercised for a limited purpose with a view to satisfying itself that the decision was according to law.\nthe high court could not substitute its own finding for the one reached by the courts below on a reappraisal of evidence.\nin the instant case the basic question is whether keeping in background the partnership deeds referred to hereinbefore and the facts that came to light was there partnership or not.\nsharing of profits and contributing to losses were not the only elements in a partnership existence of agency was essential and whether there was a partnership or not is a mixed question of law and fact depending upon the varying circumstances in different cases.\nthis view was reiterated by chief justice beaumont in chimanram motilal and another v jayantilal chhaganlal and another a i r 1939 bombay 410 1939 indlaw mum 155 ramaswami j in mohammed musa sahib dead and others v n k mohammed ghouse sahib and another a i r 1959.\nmadras 379 1958 indlaw mad 820 observed that whether the relation of partnership between two or more persons does or does not exit must depend on the real intention and contract of the parties and not merely on their expressed intention.\nhe also referred to section 4 of the partnership act about the principles of partnership namely1 there must be agreement entered into by all the persons concerned 2 the agreement must be to share the profits of a business and 3 the business must be carried on by all or any of the persons concerned acting for all.\nin the instant case judged by the aforesaid principles it is possible to hold that there was a partnership of which the appellant was a partner.\nthe court of small causes considered these principles evaluated the evidence and held that there was in fact and in law a partnership.\nsuch a view was not an impossible one or a perverse one.\nif that was so there was nothing that could be clone about such a view within the ambit and scope of the power of section 292 of the rent act.\nwe may mention that in gundalapalli rangamannar chetty v desu rangiah and others a i r 1954.\nmadras 182subba rao j as the learned chief justice then was held that there can not be a subletting unless the lessee parted with legal possession.\nthe mere fact that another is allowed to use the premises while the lessee retains the legal possession is not enough to create a sub lease.\nin the light of the aforesaid principles and the facts that have emerged we are of the opinion that the high court exceeded its jurisdiction under section 292 of the rent act.\nwe are further of the opinion that the court of small causes was right in the view it took.\nand it was a possible view to take.\nin the result the appeal is allowed and the judgment and order of the gujarat high court dated 21st of august1979 are set aside.\nthe order and judgment of the court of small causes ahmedabad dated 18th of august1977 are restored.\nthe suit for possession is accordingly dismissed.\nthe appellant herein is entitled to the costs throughout.\nappeal

        "text": "this appeal is by special leave against the judgment and decree of the high court of kerala which dismissed an appeal against the judgment and decree of the subordinate court of havelikkara.\nthe appellant had filed a suit on october 24 1942 for the recovery of rs 2 lakhs and interest thereon from the date of suit and for costs originally against the state of travancore now the state of kerala the respondent and three others who however were not made parties in the appeal before the high court.\nit has alleged in the plaint that the plaintiff appellant was wrongfully dispossessed from 160 acres of land along with the improvements which had been effected by him and as the state had appropriated those improvements without any right or title thereto he claimed the value of those improvements.\nit was the appellant 's case that he had been in occupation of the said 160 acres of cherikkal land unregistered dry lands in hilly tracts about which and the adjoining lands there was a dispute as to whether the same belonged to a jenmi family known as koodalvalli illom hereinafter called the illom or to the government of the erstwhile travancore state.\nthe appellant 's father and the appellant had occupied these lands made improvement thereon by planting coconut trees arecanut palms peppervines rubber trees jack trees other trees and by constructing bungalow huts wells etc.\nin the bona fide belief that the lands belonged to the illom.\nit was stated that according to the practice prevailing in the erstwhile state of travancore the cultivators could enter into unoccupied waste lands belonging to the janmies with the object of cultivating and improving them and as they held the lands under them by paying rent the consent of the jemies to such occupation was implied.\nthis practice it seems was also current in respect of lands belonging to the government before the travancore land conservancy act 4 of 1091 24 7 1916 hereinafter called the act.\nit is the case of the appellant that even after the act was passed unauthorised occupants of land belonging to the government who had made improvements therein had under the rules made both under the act and the land assignment act a preferential claim over others for getting kuthakapattom or assignment of the property in their possession.\nit may be mentioned that in respect of the 160 acres of land of the illom which were occupied by the appellant 's father and the appellant there was a dispute between the illom and the travancore state from about 1848.\nwhile this dispute was pending it appears the appellant applied to the conservator of forests for registration of the lands in his name but the application was rejected on june 14 1919 stating that the land applied for can not be registered ext.\na while the application for registration was pending the dispute between the illom and the state of travancore had reached a stage when the illom had to institute a suit o section No.\n126 of 1096.\njanuary 1918 in the district court at quilon for a declaration of its title to those properties.\nin that suit the appellant after his application for registration was rejected sought to get himself impleaded but that application also was rejected.\nthereafter the suit filed by the illom was dismissed on 28 6 1109 february 10 1934.\nan appeal against it was dismissed on september 27 1943.\nit may here be mentioned that while the suit of the illom i e o s No 126 of 1096 m e was pending in the district court quilon the government of travancore had initiated proceedings in ejectment against the appellant by l c case.\n112 of 1100 1925 a d as the suit of the illom had been finally disposed of and the title of the illom to the lands was not established the appellant apprehending that he might be ejected in the above l c case filed a suit.\no s 156 of 1103 m e 1927 28 a d in the district court at quilon against the respondent to establish his right and title to the said 160 acres and in the adjoining cherikkal lands in his possession.\nin that suit an injunction was prayed for in respect of 100 acres of the property involved in the suit but the prayer was rejected.\nagainst that order a civil miscellaneous appeal No 206 of 1110 m e 1934 35 a d was filed in the high court of travancore.\nthe high court issued a commission for inspecting the properties and the commissioner in his report part 13 of ext.\ncc set out the improvements made by the appellant on the lands which comprised of a bungalow in which the appellant was residing a number of small houses.\na rubbers state and a large number of other valuable trees like jack trees mango trees coconut trees etc.\nit appears that as there was no injunction restraining his dispossession in l c case.\n112 of 11 00 m e an order was passed for dispossessing the appellant on july 24 1939 ext.\nthe appellant pursuant to this order was dispossessed from the lands and possession of these lands was given to the second defendant nair service society ltd in august 1939.\nthereafter the suit out of which this appeal arises was filed against the government on october 24 1942.\nthe respondent state contended that the appellant encroached on the suit lands that proceedings were taken against him in l c case.\n112 of 11 00 m e and he was evicted in due course that the trespass by the appellant was of recent origin that the allegation that the entry was made in the belief that the land belonged to the illom was false that the revenue and forest departments did not harass the appellant but they took steps for dispossessing him only in accordance with the law that the commissioner 's report was not correct in that all the improvements noted by the commissioner were not made by the appellant but by other independent squatters that after due notice an order of forfeiture had been passed in l c case.\n112 of 1100 m e and the appellant was therefore not entitled to claim any value for improvements as it was his duty to remove any building before he was evicted.\nthe respondent also averred that it had not taken possession of any crops or movables as stated in the plaint and that the movables found in the building were attached for the realisation of arrears of fine etc.\nthere were other allegations also but it is unnecessary for purposes of this appeal to refer to them.\nseveral issues were framed but it is not necessary to refer to them except to say that the suit was decreed only for rs 3000 being the value of the appellant 's bungalow taken possession of by the respondent.\nthe rest of the claim was dismissed.\nit was observed by the trial court that though there is no specific evidence to show when exactly the possession of the appellant had commenced the evidence however indicated that it must have started close to the year i 100 m e and that in any case the claim of the appellant that possession was from 1030 m e was not true inasmuch as from the year 1067 m e when the act was passed possession without permission was penal and it could not be imagined that the appellant was left in peace for all these long years.\nthe trial court also held that all through these long years there had been a dispute as to the title between the illom and the state and after the suit of the illom was dismissed and the illom 's title was not sustained the allegation that the improvements were effected can not be stated to be bona fide.\nit pointed out that the plaintiff appellant had applied to get himself impleaded on 0 s No 126 of 1096 m e but his application was rejected and after that suit was dismissed the appellant again applied for registry but that was also rejected.\nall this according to the trial court would show that the appellant was aware that he was remaining on government lands without title.\nit was further held that the greater part of the improvements were affected by the appellant after the proceedings in the l c case No 112 of 1100 m e were stayed as such it can not be said that these improvements could have been effected in good faith.\nwith respect to the allegation that an order of forfeiture was not served on the appellant under section 9 of the act the court observed that though the state had in its written statement contended that such an order had been passed no order was produced in evidence and consequently it was conceded by the government pleader that no such order was passed.\nin the circumstances the question that had to be considered was whether without an order of forfeiture being passed the respondent could forfeit the improvements.\non this issue it was held that no notice of forfeiture of trees.\nneed be given under section 9 of the act and therefore no compensation or damages were payable in respect thereof.\nthe high court accepted the finding of the trial court on issue.\nit observed that the evidence in the case indicated that the possession of the father of the appellant must have commenced close to the year 1100 m e and consequently the claim of the appellant that lie was in possession from 1030 m e can not be true.\nit then said if the possession commenced only about the year 1100 it certainly can not be under any bona fide claim of title for even on.\n12 6 1094 the petitioner knew that the land was government land and had then applied for assignment of the land.\naccordingly the high court found that at no time the occupation of the land by the appellant was under a bona fide claim of title.\nthe contention of the appellant that the trees which are the subject matter of the appeal should have been forfeited by an order passed under section 9 of the act and in the absence of such.\nan order his right to the value of those trees had to be adjudged and paid.\nto him was also negatived as the court held that the words any crop or other product raised on the land occurring in section 9 of the act would not include trees.\nin its view these words take in what is familiarly known in law as emblements which according to black 's.\nlaw dictionary mean such products of the soil as are annually planted served and saved by manual labour as cereals vegetables grass maturing for harvest or harvested etc but not grass on lands used for pasturage.\nin this view it held that compensation for trees which are to be dealt with under the general law can not be decreed in favour of a mere trespasser who had no rights therein.\nit was also of the view that the claim for compensation for trees which has to be dealt with under the general law under which a mere trespasser would have no rights to the payment of compensation nor could be.\nappellant be allowed to remove them after his dispossession.\nanother reason for disallowing the compensation for trees given by the high court was that the position of a trespasser whether he be a mere trespasser or a trespasser under a bona fide claim of title cannot be better than that of a tenant and that if this is correct then the appeal has to be dismissed on the short ground that there is no principle of law or equity which requires the payment of compensation in respect of trees the ownership of which was all along or at any rate from the dale of the trespasser 's dispossession vested in the state.\nthe learned advocate for the appellant has reiterated the submissions made before the trial court and the high court and contends that there is no order forfeiting the improvements as required under section 9 of the act and if section 9 does not apply and there is no right of forfeiture as contemplated under section 9 then the appellant is entitled to compensation under the general law.\napart from this contention towards the end of his argument the learned advocate for the appellant sought to make out a fresh case namely that as the appellant was not served with a notice to quit as required under section 9 of the act but was forcibly evicted without giving him an opportunity of cutting and taking away the trees etc.\nfrom the lands from which he was evicted he would be entitled to claim compensation for the improvements made by him.\nit may be stated that the finding that the possession of the appellant commenced after his application for registration was rejected in 1919 and the improvements if any must have been effected only thereafter with full knowledge that the title to the lands was in dispute between the illom and the government is unassailable.\nwe have earlier adverted to ext.\na and also to the fact that after the application for registration was rejected the appellant tried to get himself impleaded in the suit filed by the illom against the state which application was also rejected and so the claim that his possession was bona fide or that he was a bona fide trespasser has no validity.\nthis finding is fortified by section 5 of the act which provides that from and after the commencement of the act it shall not be lawful for any person to occupy land which is the property of the government whether poramboke or not without the permission from the government or such officer of the government as may be empowered in that behalf.\nin view of this specific provision the contravention of which is punishable under section 6 thereof his conduct in applying for registration and for getting himself impleaded in the suit of the illom against the government would show that he knew that the land was government land or land in which the government had a claim.\nin these circumstances he can not be said to be a bona fide trespasser particularly after he had applied to the government for obtaining a.\nregistration in his name on the basis that it was government land.\nit is however urged before us that the high court was in error in thinking that the appellant did not occupy the lands as a trespasser with a bona fide claim of title because it was his case that he trespassed upon the land with a bona fide intention to improve the land and as such he can still be considered as a bona fide trespasser entitled to improvements under the general law.\nbefore dealing with this aspect we will first consider the question whether trees are included within the meaning of section 9 so as to entitle the appellant to a notice of forfeiture there under.\nsection 9 of the act is in the following terms any person unauthorised occupying any land for which he is liable to pay a fine under section 6 and an assessment or prohibitory assessment under section 7 may be summarily evicted by the division peishkar and any crop or other product raised on the land shall be liable to forfeiture and any building or other structure erected or anything deposited thereon shall also if not removed by him after such written notice as the division peishkar may deem reasonable be liable to forfeiture.\nforfeiture under this section shall be disposed of as the division peishkar may direct.\nan eviction under this section shall be made in the following manner namely by serving a notice on a person reported to be in occupation or his agent requir ing him within such time as the division peishkar may deem reasonable after receipt of the said notice to vacate the land and if such notice is not obeyed by removing or deputing a subordinate to remove any person who may refuse to vacate the same and if the officer removing any such person shall be resisted or obstructed by any person the division peishkar shall hold a summary enquiry into the facts of the case and if satisfied that the resistance or obstruction still continues may issue a warrant for the arrest of the said person and on his appearance may send him with a warrant in the form of the schedule for imprisonment in the civil jail of the district for such period not exceeding 30 days as may be necessary to prevent the continuance of such obstruction or resistance provided that no person so committed or imprisoned under this section shall be liable to be prosecuted under sections 176 179 and 181 of the travancore penal code in respect of the same facts.\nthis section provides for two notices to be given one notice is to be given to the person who is in unauthorised occupation of government land to vacate the land within a reasonable time and the other notice is to forfeit any crop or other product raised on the land or to remove any building or other structure erected or anything deposited therein within a reasonable time as may be stated in the notice.\nit was conceded before the trial court and no attempt was made to establish anything to the contrary before the high court that no notice of forfeiture as required under section 9 was given to the appellant.\nin these circumstances the question that would arise for determination is whether the trees come within the description of other product raised on the land.\nit is stated before us that at the time when the appellant was evicted the transfer of property act was not in force.\nbut this is not relevant as what has to be considered is whether trees can be said to be other product raised on the land.\nthe words raised on the land qualify both the crop and other product so the words other product have to be read in the context of the word crop which precedes it.\nit was pointed out by the learned advocate that the high court was in error in equating other product raised on the land with emblements because the definition of crop in black 's law dictionary does include emblements as such the words other product can not also be treated as emblements and must therefore be given a different meaning which according to him would include trees.\nno doubt one of the meanings given in the black 's law dictionary does say that in a more restricted sense the word is synonymous with fructus industrials.\nbut the meaning to be ascribed to that word is that it connotes in its larger signification products of the soil that are grown and raised yearly and are gathered during a single season.\nin this sense the term includes fructus industrials and having regard to the etymology of the word it has been held to mean only products after they have been severed from the soil.\nthe same dictionary gives the meaning of the word product as follows product with reference to property proceeds.\nyield income receipts return.\nthe products of a farm may include the increase of cattle on the premises.\neven under this definition product can not mean anything which is attached to the land like trees.\nit may however include the fruit of the trees.\nthis view of ours is supported by the case of clark and another v gaskarth 8 taunt 431.\nthat was a case of a trespass for breaking and entering the closes of the plaintiffs and tearing up digging up cutting down and carrying away the plaintiff 's trees plants roots and seeds growing on the closes.\nnotice of this trespass was given to the defendant.\nat the time of the distress the sum of pound 281 6 section was due from the plaintiffs to the defendant for rent in respect of the nursery ground.\nthe question before the court was whether the plaintiffs were entitled to recover against the defendant damages caused to them by cutting down and carrying away the plaintiffs trees.\nit was contended that the defendant 's action was justified under the statute ii g 2 c 19 section 8 which after enumerating certain crops empowered the landlord to seize as a distress any other product whatsoever which shall be growing on any part of the estate demised and therefore the trees and shrubs in question came within that description.\nthe court rejected the contention that the trees and shrubs could be detrained and held that the word product in the eighth section of the statute did not extend to trees and shrubs growing in a nurseryman 's ground but that it was confined to products of a similar nature.\nwith those specified in that section to all of which the process of becoming ripe and of being cut gathered made and laid up when ripe was incidental.\nin our view therefore trees are not included within the meaning of other products raised on the land in section 9 of the act and there is therefore no obligation on the government to give notice of forfeiture under that section.\nit is then contended that even if trees are not included in section 9 and no notice of forfeiture is necessary under the general law even a trespasser on the land whether bona fide or not is entitled to compensation or damages for the improvements made by him on the land.\nwe have already agreed with the trial court and the high court that the appellant was not a bona fide trespasser.\nbut the learned advocate for the appellant submits that it was not his case nor is it under the general law necessary for a person who trespassed on the land to trespass with a claim of bona fide title.\naccording to his submission a person is nevertheless a bona fide trespasser if he enters upon the land with a bona fide intention of improving the land.\nno authority has been cited for this novel proposition and if accepted it would give validity to a dangerous principle which will condone all acts of deliberate and wrongful trespass because any person desparate enough to trespass on other mans land without any claim of title can always plead that he had a bona fide intention of improving the land whether the owner of that land wants that improvement or not.\nthis vicarious and altruistic exhibition of good intention may even cause damage to the land of an owner who may not want improvements of such a kind as tree plantation.\nit is true that the maxim of the english law quicquid plantatur solo solo cedit i e whatever is affixed to the soil belongs to the soil is.\nnot applicable in india but that is not to say that a wrongful trespasser can plant trees on someone else 's land and claim a right to those trees after he is evicted.\nthe case of vallabdas narainji v development officer bandra a i r 1929.\np c 163 1929 indlaw pc 11 which was cited by the learned counsel for the appellant does not assist him for the privy council did not think it necessary to give a decision on what it termed to be a far reaching contention.\nthat was a case in which the government had taken possession of the lands and had erected certain building on the land before a decision under section 6 of the land acquisition act was made as to the appellant 's property arid it was contended that the appellant should be allowed the value of the land in the state in which it then was i e with buildings on it.\nit appears that the government had resolved to acquire the land in question and other lands and by arrangement with certain of the sutidars it took possession of such land including a portion which was in the occupation of the appellant.\nupon such land including a portion in the possession of the appellant they proceeded to erect buildings without the necessary notification under section 6 of the land acquisition act which was not served until november 4 1920.\non these findings it was observed that the government were in a position by law at any rate to regularize their possession by such a notification a fact which becomes material when it has to be considered what the nature of the trespass is.\nboth the assistant judge and the high court negatived the claim of the appellant.\nbefore the privy council it was contended on behalf of the appellant that in the various cases relied upon there was at least some genuine claim or belief in the party erecting the buildings that he had a title to do so even though he was eventually held to be a trespasser and it was urged that no such claim or belief existed in that case in which it was said the government without any pretence of a right tortuously invaded the appellant 's property and proceeded to deal with it as their own.\nit is in this context that the respondent 's contention that even if the appellants were considered to be mere trespassers they would still be entitled to the value of the improvements and contest the claim of the appellant was described as already stated as a far reaching contention.\nthe board however agreed with what was apparently the view of both courts in india that under the circumstances of this case as already set forth by the law of india which they appear to have correctly interpreted the government officials were in possession not as mere trespassers but under such a colour of title that the buildings erected by them on the land ought not to be included in the valuation as having become the property of the landowner.\nthis case does not support the contention that a mere trespasser who has deliberately and wrongfully contrary to the provisions of section 5 of the act entered upon another 's land which makes such an act even punishable under section 6 thereof is entitled to compensation for the trees planted by him on the land.\nin any case as the high court rightly observed the position of a trespasser can not be better than that of a lawful tenant who having lost his possession can not claim compensation or damages for anything erected on the land or any improvements made therein.\nthe appellant 's claim after he was evicted can not on the same parity of reasoning be held to be valid.\nonce the appellant 's counsel was confronted i with this proposition he tried to raise an entirely new point namely that no notice of eviction was given to the appellant and if such a notice had been given to him under section 9 he would have cut the trees and taken them away within the time allowed for him to vacate the lands.\nin support of this contention he has referred us to the leadings contained in paragraph 3 of the plaint in which it is stated the improvements effected by the plaintiff have a value of rs 2 lakhs as per the accounts shown below.\nin his helplessness the plaintiff had even applied to government to give him the land in which he had effected improvements on kuthakapattom.\nbut out of the said land 160 acres were taken out of my possession and given to the 2nd defendant even without giving me the opportunity to remove the movable improvements such as cultivation cattle machines utensils houses stocked crops ripe crops etc belonging to me.\nthese averments in the above paragraph do not clearly allege that he was not evicted without notice nor has any allegation been made that he was forcibly evicted from the lands with the help of the police etc.\nas it has now been contended before us.\non the other hand what the plaintiff appellant stated shows that no opportunity was given to him to remove the movable improvements such as cultivation cattle machines utensils houses stocked crops ripe crops etc.\nwhich belonged to him.\nthere is nothing stated by him that he had no opportunity to cut trees and take them away.\neven in paragraph 4 of the plaint where he complains that no notice of forfeiture was given to him he mentions only the items referred to in paragraph 3.\nit is in this connection he says that no legal procedure had been followed by government for taking them into possession which only implies that it is in respect of the items mentioned in paragraph 3.\nit is again stated in paragraph 4 that it was irregular on the part of government to take possession of the above items.\nthe respondent did not understand the averments in the plaint as alleging that no notice to quit was given to him is evident from the written statement of the respondent in paragraph where it is stated thus.\nthis defendant submits that after due notice an order of forfeiture has been passed in poramboke case 112 of 11 00 and the plaintiff is therefore not entitled to claim any value of improvements or value of any building.\nthe issues that had been famed by the trial court also do not refer to this aspect.\nno doubt in the evidence of the plaintiff p w 1 states that he was evicted from the lands without giving him an opportunity to remove the improvements and in cross examination he was asked whether he was not given any notice prior to the dispossession and he said that certainly no notice was received.\np w 4 the manager was asked in cross examination whether he had been given any priorinformation or notice about eviction and this witness also said that there was no prior information or notice.\nwhile these passages might show that no notice of eviction was given even at that stage there was no application for an issue being framed nor has such an application been made in the appeal before the high court nor even before this court.\nin it has been held that the appellant was not a mere trespasser and had deliberately entered upon the lands knowing full well that he had no right claim or title to the lands or had in any manner a right to enter the land and has been rightly evicted as a trespasser he can not now be permitted to raise this contention before us.\nin the view we have taken the appeal has no substance and is accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs but the court fee will be recovered from the appellant.\nappeal dismissed.",

thereafter while disposing of both the writ petition and the letters patent appeal allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits.\nthe said order of the division bench is under challenge in this appeal.\nthe core question which arises for our consideration is as to whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 461b was maintainable.\nbefore adverting thereto we may take notice of the relevant statutory provisions ss 461b481482 and 56 read as under section 46 removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non use  1 subject to the provisions of section 47a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either a b that up to a date one month before the date of the application a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being provided that except where the applicant has been permitted under sub s 3 of s 12 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of the goods in question or where the tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark the tribunal may refuse an application u cl a or cl b in relation to any goods if it is shown that there has been before the relevent date or during the relevant period as the case may be bona fide use of the trade mark by any proprietor thereof for the time being in relation to goods of the same description being goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered.\nsection 48 registered users  1 subject to the provisions of section 49a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as the registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trademark is registered otherwise than as a defensive trade mark but the central government may by rules made in this behalf provide that no application for registration as such shall be enertained unless the agreement between the parties complies with the conditions laid down in the rules for preventing trafficking in trade marks.\nthe permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof and shall be deemed not to be used by a person other than the proprietor for the purposes of s 46 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under this act or any other law.\nsection 56 power to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register  1.\non application made in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar by any person aggrieved the tribunal may make such order as it may think fit for cancelling or varying the registration of a trade mark on the ground of any contravention or failure to observe a condition entered on the register in relation thereto.\nany person aggrieved by the absence or omission from the register of any entry or by any entry made in the register without sufficient cause or by any entry wrongly remaining on the register or by any error of defect in any entry in the register may apply in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar and the tribunal may make such order for making expunging or varying the entry as it may think fit.\nthe tribunal may in any proceeding under this section decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide in connection with the rectification of the register.\nthe tribunal of its own motion may after giving notice in the prescribed manner to the parties concerned and after giving them an opportunity of being heard make any order referred to in sub s 1 or sub s 2.\nany order of the high court rectifying the register shall direct that notice of the rectification shall be served upon the registrar in the prescribed manner who shall upon receipt of such notice rectify the register accordingly.\nthe power to rectify the register conferred by this section shall include the power to remove a trade mark registered in part a of the register to part b of the register.\nindisputably the scope of the provisions for removal from register in terms of s 46 and 56 of the act stand on different footings.\nwhereas s 46 had a limited application s 56 of the act is wider in nature.\nconcededly cl a of sub s 1 of s 46 is not attracted in the case.\nfor the purpose of appreciation of the rival contentions we may notice the findings of the board as also the high court.\nthe board has taken the view that the period of five years and one month will begin to run from the date on which thukral became the proprietor of the trademark that is30th may1986 and therefore the rectification application could have been filed by the appellant only sometime in 1991 opining that an application for rectification against the appellant within a period of seven and a half months from the date of assignment of the trade mark was not maintainable the application was dismissed.\nthe high court on the other hand opined it was not anybody 's case before us that m s jain industries.\nthe registered proprietor of the trademark used it at all.\nthe trademark was used by the appellant and thukral neither of whom were proprietors thereof except that thukral claims to have become its proprietor with effect from 30th may1986 according to learned counsel for the appellant the use of the trademark by thukral was not legally permissible use inasmuch as thukral did not have the consent tacit or otherwise of m s jain industries to use the trademark.\nif thukral did then it can not be said that there was no bona fide use thereof by its proprietor.\nthat is m s jain industries.\nthis appears to be the position at least till 30th may1986 in.\nthe meantime as a result of the ex parte ad interim injunction granted on 19th december 1985 by this court in suit no 2408 of 1985there was no question of thukral using the trademark field marshal till the injunction was vacated on 19th january1988.\nthe act was enacted to provide for the registration and better protection of trademarks and for the prevention of the use of fraudulent marks of merchandise.\nregistration of a trade mark remains valid for seven years.\nrenewal applications are required to be filed on the expiry of seven years.\nm s jain industries got itself registered and obtained periodical renewal thereof as is required under the act.\nfirst respondent withdrew the application against m s jain industries.\nthe prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps goods so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned.\nit is in the aforementioned situation we are called upon to determine the meaning of the words for the time being occurring in s 461b of the act.\ntwo interpretations thereto which are possible are 1 the said words would denote non use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer and 2 the mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor.\nwe may however also notice that another construction of the said provision has been put forth by mr sunderam learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the word proprietor would not mean a registered proprietor but also a person who has become proprietor by long use thereof.\nthe words for the time being would mean differently in different situations.\nit may mean the moment or existing position as was held by this court in the case of jivendra nath kaul v collector district magistrate and anr 1992.\n3 scc 576 1992 indlaw sc 1107 or in the context of cl 22 of art 366 of the constitution as has been held in h h maharajadhiraja.\nmadhav rao jivaji rao scindia bahadur of gwalior h h maharajadhiraja.\nmaharana shri bhagwat singhji bahadur of udaipur v union of india and anr air 1971.\nsc 530 1970 indlaw sc 300 para 88 to mean by the use of the expression for the time being in cl 22 of art 366.\nthe president is not invested with authority to accord a temporary recognition to a ruler nor with authority to recognize or not to recognize a ruler arbitrarily the expression for them time being predicts that there shall be a ruler of the indian state that if the first recognized ruler dies or ceases to be a ruler a successor shall be appointed and that there shall not be more rulers than one at a given time.\nthe terms also may bring within its umbrage the entire period of five years or more irrespective of the fact as to whether the registered proprietor was one or more than one as has been held by the high court.\nthere can not be any doubt or dispute that the registration of a trade mark confers a very valuable right.\nthe person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner.\nit confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered.\nthe same is an assignable right in terms of s 36 of the act whereas an unregistered trade mark is not.\nuser of the said mark therefore entails the consequences laid down under cl b of sub s 1 of s 46.\nhowever such an application can be filed only by a person aggrieved.\nwhen the applicant before the board establishes the fact in regard to non user of the mark for a period of more than five years on the part of the registered owner the latter may show that his case falls within the purview of sub s 3 of s 46.\nthe question which therefore arises is as to who can prove that he had the bona fide intention to use the trade mark on the date of application for registration.\nindisputably it would be the registered proprietor.\ns 46 is a penal provision.\nit provides for civil or evil consequences.\nit takes away the valuable right of a registered proprietor.\nit therefore can be taken away only when the conditions laid down therefor are satisfied.\nwhile we say so we are not oblivious of the fact that trafficking in trade mark is to be discouraged.\na registered proprietor of a trade mark should not be permitted to circumvent the law of user of the trade mark for a long time by assigning the same from time to time.\nbut then such a case has to be made out.\nallegation of trafficking is a serious one.\nit must be proved in presence of the person against whom such allegations are made.\nat the time of grant of original registration advertisements are issued and objections are called for.\nrenewal of registration in a sense also is not automatic.\na person who had been using the said trade mark as a proprietor thereof by user is supposed to keep itself abreast with such applications filed by another either for registration of the trade mark or renewal thereof.\nthe non user for a long time would disentitle a registered proprietor from renewal of the registration.\nit must not however be forgotten that s 461b provides for a special remedy.\nas a person obtains a right on and from the date of registration andor renewal thereof he can ordinarily be deprived of his right unless it is shown that the assignment thereof by his holder was not a bona fide one or had been made by way of camouflage.\nif the assignee has obtained assignment for bona fide use he may not be fastened with any liability owing to non user on the part of his predecessor.\nin other words the mistake of the predecessor should not be visited with non use of the present registered owner.\nit

as to since when it had been doing so.\nit obtained an or of injunction.\nthe order of injunction was vacated.\nfor one reason or the other the said order attained finality.\nprima facie therefore appellant has been held to be the registered owner of the trade mark.\nit is one thing to say that for the purpose of frustrating an application for rectification the appellant had colluded with its predecessor for the purpose of trafficking by entering into the deed of assignment which is otherwise illegal and bad in law.\nbut it is another thing to say that the appellant could be proceeded against alone for non user of the registered trade mark for a period of more than five years.\nfor the purpose of making out such a case both the original registrants as also the assignee were required to be impleaded as parties.\nwe may at this stage notice that in law of trade marks by mr k c kailasam while commenting on s 47 of the trade marks act1999 to which our attention has been drawn by mr sudhir chandra it is stated.\nnotes on clauses.\nthis clause corresponds to s 46 of the existing act and provides for removal of a trade mark from the register on the ground of non use.\na trade mark which is not used within five years of its registration becomes liable for removal either completely or in respect of those goods or services for which the mark has not been used.\nunder s 461it is proposed to clarify that the five years period will start from the date on which the trade mark is actually entered on the register.\nthis amendment is intended to remove any ambiguity as for all other purposes the date of registration will be the date on which the application was filed vide cl 232 proviso to sub cl 1 also provides that the tribunal may refuse removal of the mark if it is shown that any proprietor had in fact made bona fide use of the trademark for goods or services of the same description or associated goods or services.\nit is also proposed to increase the period from 1 to 3 months in cl 471a and b in which use of the trade mark prior to the date of filing of the application for removal of the trade mark shall be disregarded.\nthis is intended to prevent the registered proprietor to by pass the act by such token use after he comes to know that an application for removal is about to be filed sub cl 3 protects a mark from being removed from the register on ground of non use if such non use is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade.\nthe clause is proposed to be modified to clarify that special circumstances in the trade will include restrictions imposed by any law or regulation on the use of trade mark in india.\nconsequential amendments have been made to cover services cl 47 of the bill.\nthe court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof.\nit seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment.\nthus a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out.\nsuch an application may be maintainable in terms of s 56 of the act but strictly not in terms of s 461b thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor.\nwe are not satisfied with the explanation offered by the first respondent that it gave up the case of non use of the registered trade mark against m s jain industries on the basis of statement made by the learned counsel for the appellant firstly because consent does not confer jurisdiction secondly because want andor lack of jurisdiction on the part of the tribunal can not be waived as if any order is passed without jurisdiction the same would be a nullity and thirdly because the cause of action even according to the first respondent in his application before the high court was different.\nthe counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant did not state that it had waived its right so far as non impleadment of m s jain industries was concerned.\nit only consented for grant of liberty in favour of the first respondent for filing of an application for the self same cause of action.\nthe question of maintainability of the second suit is absence of the registrant proprietor was not and could not have been the subject matter of consent at that stage.\nthe cause of action which permitted the first respondent to file an application for rectification against m s jain industries was non user thereof by it.\nits non user and rectification of the register could not in the aforementioned situation have been tagged with the cause of action if any against the appellant.\nthe second contention of mr that the appellant was an infringer of the trade mark is again a question of fact.\nthe right of the first respondent as a proprietor of the trade mark by reason of a long user is required to be determined vis  vis m s jain industries as also the appellant in the suit filed by it which is pending.\nthe board could not while exercising its jurisdiction under s 461bof the act proceeded on the basis of such presumption.\nit is not correct that no cause of action survived against jain industries.\nit was not lost by reason of assignment as was contended by the learned counsel.\nin the suit only the competing right of the first respondent qua the appellant can be determined and not a right against m s such a right can not be determined in a proceeding under s 461b of the act which is restricted to non user of the registered trade mark.\nboth the appellant and the respondent no 1 were the infringers of the right of m s jain industries as it was the registered proprietor of the trade mark in respect of the goods in question namely centrifugal pumps.\ntwo interpretations of the said provision s 461b are possible.\nwhile interpreting the same however certain basic principles of construction of statute must be kept in mind.\nas it takes away somebody 's right it deserves strict construction.\njurisdiction of the board being dependent on determination of the foundational facts the same was required to be established on the basis of the averments made in the application and not otherwise.\nthe right of a registered trade mark is not lost automatically on the expiry of five years and one month.\nit does not provide for a sun set law.\nit has to be adjudicated upon.\nwhether the registered proprietor of the trade mark had taken recourse to trafficking or not must be determined in an appropriate proceeding.\nthe principle of purchaser of a property has a duty to make enquiriestherefore cannot apply in a case of this nature.\nso long as the right to assign a registered trade mark remains valid once the same is validly assigned the assignee derives the same right as that of the assignor in terms of the statute.\na title to a trade mark derived on assignment as provided for under the act can not be equated with a defective title acquired in any other property as admittedly on the date of assignment the right of the registered trade mark was not extinguished.\nboth the findings of the high court which we have noticed hereinbefore are findings on question of law and in that view of the matter the contention of mr sudhir chandra that the merit of the matter is yet to be gone into by the board can not be a ground for ignoring the submissions made at the bar.\nour attention has again been drawn to a passage from law of trade marks geographical indications by shri k c kailasam wherein the judgment of the tribunal has been criticized in the following terms from the above legislative intent it would seem that the period of non use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration.\nin the case of american home products corporation v mac laboratories pvt ltd.\nrendered under the 1958 act it was held by the supreme court that the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove.\nsuch continuous non user.\nit would appear that neither the u k act nor the indian act at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration every time there is change in the ownership of the mark.\nif that be so any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s 471a and b further it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to the provisions of the act and any rights vested in any other person see.\ns 37 the assignor can not obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the act.\nwe do not think that the approach of the learned author is entirely correct.\nan assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses.\nif his title is not extinguished by reason of a provision of a statute for non user of the trade mark for a period of five years any assignment made shall be valid subject to such situation which we have noticed in paragraph 25 supra.\nfor the views we have taken we are of the opinion that the impugned judgment can not be sustained.\nit is set aside accordingly.\nthe board shall however proceed to determine afresh the application filed by the first in the light of the legal principles explained above.\nthe appeal is allowed with costs.\ncounsel 's fee assessed at rs 100000.\nappeal allowed.",

        "text": "promissory estoppel is defined in black 's law distionary as an estoppel which arises when there is a promise which promissor should reasonable expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of promisee and which does include such action or forbearance and such promise is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of promise. in central london property trust ltd vs high trees house ltd 1947 1 k b 130 high trees case the principle stated is that where one party has by his words or conduct made to the other a promise or assurance which was intended to affect the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly then once the other party has taken him at his word and acted on it the party who gave the promise or assurance can not afterwards be allowed to revert to the previous legal relationship as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him but he must accept their legal relations subject to the qualification which he himself has so introduced even though it is not supported in point of law by any consideration but only by his word. but that principle does not create any cause of action which did not exist before so that where a promise is made which is not supported by any consideration the promise can not bring an action on the basis of that promise. no vested right as to tax holding is acquired by a person who is granted concession. if any concession has been given it can be withdrawn at any time and no time limit should be insisted upon before it was withdrawn. the rule of promissory estoppel can be invoked only if on the basis of representation made by the government the industry was established to avail benefit if of exemption. a person may have a legitimate expectation of being treated in a certain way by an administrative authority even though he has no legal right in private law to receive such treatment. the expectation may arise either from a representation or promise made by the authority including an implied representation or from consistent past practice. the doctrine of legitimate expectation has an important place in the developing law of judicial review. it is however not necessary to explore the doctrine in this case it is enough merely to note that a legitimate expectation can provide a sufficient interest to enable one who can not point to the existence of a substantive right to obtain the leave of the court to apply for judicial review. the doctrine does not give scope to claim relief straightway from the administrative authorities as no crystallized right as such involved. the protection of such legitimate expectation does not require the fulfilment of the expectation where an overriding public interest requires otherwise. the basic requirement of article 14 is fairness in action by the state and non arbitrariness in essence and substance is the heart beat of fair play. actions are amenable in the panorama of judicial review only to the extent that the state must act validity for discernible reasons not whimsically for any ulterior purpose. the meaning and true import and concept of arbitrariness is more easily visualized than precisely defined. a question whether the impugned action is arbitrary or not is to be ultimately answered on the facts and circumstances of a given case. a basic and obvious test to apply in such cases is to see whether there is any discernible principle emerging from the impugned action and if so does if really satisfy the test of reasonableness. every state action must be informed by reason and it follows that an act uninformed by reason is per se arbitrary. something overwhelming must appear before the court will intervene. that is and ought to be a difficult onus for an applicant to discharge. there is ample room within the legal boundaries for radical differences of opinion in which neither side is unreasonable. the reasonableness in administrative law must therefore distinguish between proper course and improper abuse of power. nor is the test court 's own standard of reasonableness as it might conceive it in a given situation. the point to note is that the thing is not unreasonable in the legal sense merely because the court thinks it to be unwise. in punjab communications ltd vs union of india of others air 1999 sc 1801 1999 indlaw sc 1548 the change in policy can defeat a substantive legitimate expectation if it can be justified on wednesbury reasonableness. the decision maker has the choice in the balancing of the pros and cons relevant to the change in policy. it is therefore clear that the choice of police is for the decision maker and not the court. the legitimate substantive expectation merely permits the court to find out if the change of policy which is the cause for defeating the legitimate expectation is irrational or perverse or one which no reasonable person could have made. a claim based on merely legitimate expectation without anything more can not ipso facto give a right. its uniqueness lies in the fact that it covers the entire span of time present past and future how significant is the statement that today is tomorrows yesterday. the present is as we experience it the past is a present memory and future is a present expectation. if a denial of legitimate expectation in a given case amounts to denial of right guaranteed or is arbitrary discriminatory unfair or biased gross abuse of power of violation of principles of natural justice the same can be questioned on the well known grounds attracting article 14 but a claim based on mere legitimate expectation without anything more can not ipso facto give a right to invoke these principles. if the state acts within the bounds of reasonableness it would be legitimate to take into consideration the national priorities and adopt trade policies. as noted above the ultimate test is whether on the touchstone of reasonableness the policy decision comes out unscathed. reasonableness of restriction is to be determined in an objective manner and from the standpoint of interest of the general public and not from the standpoint of the interests of persons upon whom the restrictions have been imposed or upon abstract consideration. a restriction can not be said to be unreasonable merely because in a given case it operates harshly. the state government if it so chooses shall file its further counter affidavits before the high court within six weeks from today indicating the reasons which warranted the withdrawal of the benefits extended. the plea of the appellants regarding legitimate expectation shall be considered by the high court in the light of materials to be placed by the respondents by affidavits as directed above. the court made it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the factual aspects except indicating the principles underlying legitimate expectation. another point which was specifically raised before the high court but has not been dealt by it is the legality of the action in directing retrospective withdrawal of the benefit by a letter of the government whether the same is permissible in law has to be decided by the high court.",

        "text": "in bhagat ram v state of punjab air 1954 sc 621 1954 indlaw sc 188it was laid down that where the case depends upon the conclusion drawn from circumstances the cumulative effect of the circumstances must be such as to negative the innocence of the accused and bring the offences home beyond any reasonable doubt. in state of u p v ashok kumar srivastava1992 crl lj 1104 1992 indlaw sc 107it was pointed out that great care must be taken in evaluating circumstantial evidence and if the evidence relied on is reasonably capable of two inferences the one in favour of the accused must be accepted. it was also pointed out that the circumstances relied upon must be found to have been fully established and the cumulative effect of all the facts so established must be consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt. there is no doubt that conviction can be based solely on circumstantial evidence but it should be tested by the touch stone of law relating to circumstantial evidence laid down by the this court as far back as in 1952. the main circumstances relied upon by the prosecution relates to the statements of the accused leading to discovery of materials facts admissible under section 27 of the indian evidence act1872 in short the evidence act. the scope and ambit of section 27 of the evidence act had been stated and restated in several decisions of this court. at one time it was held that the expression fact discovered in the section is restricted to a physical or material fact which can be perceived by the senses and that it does not include a mental fact now it is fairly settled that the expression fact discovered includes not only the physical object produced but also the place from which it is produced and the knowledge of the accused as to this as noted in pulukuri kottaya 's case 1946 indlaw pc 23. in rammi alias rameshwar v state of madhya pradesh air 1999 sc 3544 1999 indlaw sc 1512 the scope and ambit of section 27 of the evidence act was analysed in great detail and it was concluded in para 12 as follows. true such information is admissible in evidence under section 27 of the evidence act but admissibility alone would not render the evidence pertaining to the above information reliable. while testing the reliability of such evidence the court has to see whether it was voluntarily stated by the accused. the alleged statement made by the accused led to discovery of knife bloodstained clothes rope etc. unfortunately for the prosecution there is no evidence to show that in fact the wearing apparels containing bloodstains belonged to the accused save and except the alleged confessional statement. no witness has spoken that those clothes were worn by the accused at any time far less at or about the time of occurrence. it is also to be kept in view that those articles were recovered from the house of p w 3 and at the initial stage of investigation p w 3 himself was one of the suspected person and he was arrested. therefore the statement of p w 3 and his mother that those articles were brought by the accused and left in the upstairs room is to be considered with a pinch of salt. moreover there is nothing to indicate that in fact the bloodstained clothes and rope had tallied with the blood grouping of the deceased. the knife did not contain any bloodstain. therefore the aspect relating to recovery of articles from the house of p w 3 and his mother can not be considered as a link to complete the chain of circumstantial evidence. the evidence of p ws 1718 and 19 is relevant. since the golden jewellery had been molten and were recovered in the shape of ingots it would be very hazardous to come to the conclusion that in fact the golden jewellery belonged to the deceased. if the accused had killed the deceased and stolen those golden jewellery there is no reason as to why he had also not taken ear rings from the deceased. the fact that ear rings were on the dead body is admitted by the prosecution. the fact that there had been a statement allegedly made by p w 1 leading to recovery of a parallel key from the dash board of the car of p w 1cannot be lost sight of. final however the very suspicious role of p w 40who apparently was in possession of at least two keys of the same lock creates suspicion regarding recovery of another key after 5 months. law is well settled that when the prosecution relies upon circumstantial evidence all the links in the chain of circumstances must be complete and should be proved through cogent evidence. when the judgment of the high court is analysed in the background of what has been stated by this court as regards circumstantial evidence the inevitable conclusion is that the impugned judgment of the high court does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant interference.",

        "text": "accused were charged with offences under sections 498a and 304b of the ipc. the fir in the present case was lodged the father of the deceased. according to this witness on 23rd january2002the marriage of his daughter was solemnised with accused pathan hussain basha and he had accepted to give rs 25000 in marriage. he had given only rs 15000 and had agreed to pay rs 10000 after four months. this witness has further specifically stated that the said accused treated his daughter in a proper manner for about two months. in the marriage he had also given a gold chain a double bed an iron safe and other items. the accused asked for rs 1000 with a ring for the deceased. the witness could pay only rs 500 upon which the accused refused to take the deceased to the matrimonial home and went away. lw 7 confirmed that rs 15000 was given at the time of marriage and rs 10000 was to be given within some time which the father of the deceased failed to provide. according to him the accused persons used to harass the deceased primarily for non payment of the amount of dowry as a result of which she was forced to commit suicide. the dowry demands were being raised by the accused persons persistently from the family of the deceased and for that they even harassed the deceased by beating and abusing her. she had informed her parents of the ill treatment and the cruelty inflicted on her for non giving of dowry. it was appropriate for the court to examine as to what are the ingredients of an offence punishable under section 304b of the ipc. in the case of biswajit halder alias babu halder and others v state of w b 2008 1 scc 202 2007 indlaw sc 304the court stated the basic ingredients to attract the provisions of section 304 b are 1 the death of a woman should be caused by burns or fatal injury or otherwise than under normal circumstances 2 such death should have occurred within seven years of her marriage 3 she must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband and 4 such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection with demand for dowry. for the purpose of section 113 b of the evidence act dowry death shall have the same meaning as in section 304 b of indian penal code. if section 304 b ipc is read together with section 113 b of the evidence act a comprehensive picture emerges that if a married woman dies in unnatural circumstances at her matrimonial home within 7 years from her marriage and there are allegations of cruelty or harassment upon such married woman for or in connection with demand of dowry by the husband or relatives of the husband the case would squarely come under dowry death and there shall be a presumption against the husband and the relatives. dowry means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly by one party to another by parents of either party to each other or any other person at before or at any time after the marriage and in connection with the marriage of the said parties but does not include dower or mahr under the muslim personal law. all the expressions used under this section are of a very wide magnitude. in satvir singh v state of punjab20018 scc 633 2001 indlaw sc 224 this court held that the word dowry should be any property or valuable given or agreed to be given in connection with the marriage. the customary payments in connection with birth of a child or other ceremonies are not covered within the ambit of the word dowry. where the husband had demanded a specific sum from his father in law and upon not being given harassed and tortured the wife and after some days she died such cases would clearly fall within the definition of dowry under the act s 4 of the act is the penal section and demanding a dowryas defined under s 2 of the act is punishable under this section. as already noticed the court need not deliberate on this aspect as the accused before the court has neither been charged nor punished for that offence. the court examined the provisions of s 2 of the act in a very limited sphere to deal with the contentions raised in regard to the applicability of the provisions of section 304 b of the code. the court can not ignore one of the cardinal principles of criminal jurisprudence that a suspect in the indian law is entitled to the protection of art 20 of the constitution of india as well as has a presumption of innocence in his favour. in other words the rule of law requires a person to be innocent till proved guilty. the concept of deeming fiction is hardly applicable to the criminal jurisprudence. in contradistinction to this aspect the legislature has applied the concept of deeming fiction to the provisions of section 304 b. where other ingredients of section 304 b are satisfied in that event the husband or all relatives shall be deemed to have caused her death. in other words the offence shall be deemed to have been committed by fiction of law. once the prosecution proves its case with regard to the basic ingredients of section 304 b the court will presume by deemed fiction of law that the husband or the relatives complained of has caused her death. such a presumption can be drawn by the court keeping in view the evidence produced by the prosecution in support of the substantive charge under section 304 b of the code. the ingredients of section 304b read with section 498a ipc are completely satisfied in the present case. by a deeming fiction in law the onus shifts on to the accused to prove as to how the deceased died. it is for the accused to show that the death of the deceased did not result from any cruelty or demand of dowry by the accused persons. the accused did not care to explain as to how the death of his wife occurred. denial can not be treated to be the discharge of onus. onus has to be discharged by leading proper and cogent evidence. it was expected of the accused to explain as to how and why his wife died as well as his conduct immediately prior and subsequent to the death of the deceased. maintaining silence can not be equated to discharge of onus by the accused. in the present case the prosecution by reliable and cogent evidence has established the guilt of the accused. there being no rebuttal thereto there is no occasion to interfere in the judgments of the courts under appeal. the offences having been proved against the accused and keeping in view the attendant circumstances the court was of the considered view that ends of justice would be met if the punishment awarded to the appellants is reduced.",

        "text": "the starting point of the incident in question as indicated from the evidence on record is the hall where apparently a dispute started between the parties with regard to the electricity connection in the house. the deceased tried to put off the light of one particular room at which the appellant and other accused persons became annoyed and the appellant switched on the light which was again switched off by the deceased. at this the deceased became annoyed and the appellant removed the fuse of the electricity which act of his plunged the entire house into darkness. it is also clear and established that thereafter a lamp was brought by accused no 3 to the room besides another lamp which was already burning in the said room itself. but in any case there was an electricity light post in the front of the house which was giving enough light to the house. there is also evidence on record to show that even outsiders were watching the incident from the road which indicates that there was sufficient light for them to see what was happening in the house where the incident had taken place. there was indeed some scuffle between the parties during the course of which accused no 1 received simple injuries and the deceased died of the two stab injuries inflicted by the present appellant. the issue with regard to the initiation of the investigation without recording the fir was succinctly addressed by this court in the case of state of u p vs bhagwant kishore joshi 1964 3 scr 71 1963 indlaw sc 268 observed as follows 17 what is investigation is not defined in the code of criminal procedure but in h n rishbud and inder singh vs state of delhi 1954 indlaw sc 14 this court has described the procedure for investigation as follows thus under the code investigation consists generally of the following steps 1 proceeding to the spot 2 ascertainment of the facts and circumstances of the case 3 discovery and arrest of the suspected offender 4 collection of evidence relating to the commission of the offence which may consist of a the examination of various persons including the accused and the reduction of their statements into writing if the officer thinks fit b the search of places of seizure of things considered necessary for the investigation and to be produced at the trial and 5 formation of the opinion as to whether on the material collected there is a case to place the accused before a magistrate for trial and if so taking the necessary steps for the same by the filing of a charge sheet. in the instant case it is quite clear from the evidence on record that pw 1 received the information about the death of the deceased from psi of panaji police station without any detail as to how the incident had happened and who had caused the incident. it was a very cryptic information received by him regarding the death of a person residing within the jurisdiction of his police station pursuant to an incident taking place on 10 04 1988 between 8 30 p m to 8 45 p m and therefore it appears that there was not enough information available to him either to get a g d entry recorded or to get an fir lodged. in order to verify the information received pw 21 went to the place of occurrence and found the entire house in total darkness. the said eye witnesses are consistent about the principal act of the appellant in stabbing the deceased. the discrepancies which were sought to be pointed out are minor discrepancies without in any manner affecting the substratum of the prosecution case and therefore minor discrepancies in the evidence of the eye witnesses are immaterial. the postmortem report indicates that there were sixteen injuries as against the two as adduced in ocular evidence and therefore a submission was made by the counsel appearing for the appellant that the medical evidence adduced in the present case is not supporting the ocular evidence. the place of occurrence is a residence inhabited by both the parties and there is no evidence on record that the deceased was armed with any weapon. records clearly establish that there was indeed a scuffle between the parties with regard to the availability of electricity in a particular room and during the course of scuffle the appellant also received an injury which was simple in nature and that there was heated exchange of words and scuffle between the parties before the actual incident of stabbing took place. there is therefore provocation and the incident happened at the spur of the moment. that being the factual position we are of the considered view that the present case can not be said to be a case section but it is a case falling under section 304 part ii ipc. it is trite law that section 304 part ii comes into play when the death is caused by doing an act with knowledge that it is likely to cause death but there is no intention on the part of the accused either to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.",

        "text": "the court noticed that the provisions of the bombay town planning rules1955 for short the bombay rules are in pari materia with the rules. a town planning scheme therefore envisages calling for objection from the persons concerned for three purposes i in regard to draft scheme ii lodging of any claim for payment of compensation iii participation in the matter of allotment of final plots. in jaswantsingh mathurasingh1991 indlaw sc 972 suprait was reiterated that a tenant or a sub tenant is a person interested and is entitled to notice. in that context it was held the question is whether the tenant or a sub tenant is a person interested and is entitled to notice it is obvious that u s 105 of transfer of property act a lease creates right or an interest in enjoyment of the demised property and a tenant or a sub tenant is entitled to remain in possession of the demised property until the lease is duly terminated and eviction takes place in accordance with law. therefore a tenant or a sub tenant in possession of a tenement in the town planning scheme is a person interested within the meaning of rules 213 and 4 of the rules. whether irrespective of rule 26 of the rules which prescribes for issuance of a general public notice any special notice upon the appellant was required to be served by the state or by the authority in our opinion cannot be gone into by us in these proceedings for the first time. validity of rule 26 of the rules had never been questioned. it had also not been contended that the said rule is ultra vires s 52 of the act. respondent no 4 was owner of both plot nos 177 and 178. he was therefore in his own right entitled to final allotment of some plot. a person may waive a right either expressly or by necessary implication. he may in a given case disentitle himself from obtaining an equitable relief particularly when he allows a thing to come to an irreversible situation. different statutes provide for different manner of service of notice. when a statute makes an elaborate provision as regards the formalities required to be undergone at every stage by the local authority the state government and other authorities concerned in preparing and making the final town planning scheme the same should be considered to be exhaustively. the following are not in dispute. a appellant although filed an objection with regard to the draft scheme did not choose to pursue it. b he did not file objections for re allotment and did not participate in the proceedings following acquisition instituted by the authorities under the act. in view of the above the issue is whether it was open to him to assert his purported right to special notice in respect of the final allotment in the instant case given the fact that he did not pursue his objections to the draft scheme and subsequently did not object participate during the proceedings for re allotment. under rule 26 of the rules applicable in the instant case as distinguished from the bombay rules wherein special notice is requiredno special notice is mandatorily required to be served. assuming however that it was obligatory for the state to issue notice to the appellant the question is whether the principle of waiver precludes him from claiming equitable relief in this case due to his earlier conduct which allowed the entire process of acquisition and allotment to become final. the court of the opinion that even if he had any such right he waived the same. it is true that waiver can not always and in every case be inferred merely from the failure of the party to take the objection. waiver can be inferred only if and after it is shown that the party knew about the relevant facts and was aware of his right to take the objection. waiver or acquiescence like election presupposes that the person to be bound is fully cognizant of his rights and that being so he neglects to enforce them or chooses one benefit instead of another either but not both of which he might claim. the legal principle emerging from these decisions is also stated in craies on statute law 6th edn at page 369 is that as a general rule the conditions imposed by statutes which authorise legal proceedings are treated as being indispensable to giving the court jurisdiction but if it appears that the statutory conditions were inserted by the legislature simply for the security or benefit of the parties to the action themselves and that no public interests are involved such conditions will not be considered as indispensable and either party may waive them without affecting the jurisdiction of the court. it must be held that the benefit of notice provided under the act and rules being for the benefit of the appellant in which no public interests are involved he has waived the same. it may safely be stated that the appellant through his conduct has waived his right to an equitable remedy in the instant case. such conduct precludes and operates as estoppel against him with respect to asserting a right over a portion of the acquired land in a situation where the scheme in question has attained finality following as a result of the appellant 's inaction.",

investigation.\nthe statement of shahu was recorded during investigation on 25 3 1991 i e about six days after the date of incident.\nharish chand sharma the investigating officer was specifically asked how the name of this witness came to his knowledge during investigation.\nhe gave an evasive answer saying that the fact that shalu was accompanying s must have come in the staement of the witnesses.\nhe was further asked to name the witness in whose statement shalu 's reference was available but the investigation officer drew a blank and could not tell the name of the witness from whom any clue as to shalu was received by him.\nthus how and in what manner the investigating officer came to learn about shalu pw7 so as to record her statement during investigation remains shrounded in mystery.\nthe fact remains that the testimony of shalu pw 7 aged 4 years even if taken at its face value does not constitute such a circumstance as to draw an incriminating inference against the accused and connect him with the crime.\nabnormal conduct of accused kalu ram pw5 stated that two or three days after the date of dead body of s having been found.\nhe and santosh.\npw9 had gone to see a movie in a cinema hall where the accused was employed as a gate keeper.\nthere the accused had enquired from them as to what was the punishment awardable to an offender who was found to have been committed rape on a girl and killed her.\nthe accused was told by the witness that the punishment could be 20 or even 40 years of imprisonment or imprisonment for life.\nthereafter the wit nesses went to see movie in the cinema hall.\nduring cross examination kalu ram stated that the accused was his neighbour previously known to him.\non a pertinent question the witness stated that while making such a query there was no change in the facial expression of the accused that is he had remained normal.\nsantosh pw9 did not support the version of kalu ram and was declared hostile.\nwithout going into the question as to whether the statement of kalu ram pw5 is to be believed or not in view of the same having not been supported by santosh pw9 let us assess the intrinsic value of such testimony as a piece of incriminating evidence.\nit appears that to begin with the death of s was a blind murder and the police was clue less about the likely offender.\nthe police appears to have embarked upon a search akin to a combing operation and in that process several suspected characters were called and interrogated.\nharish chand sharma pw21 stated that between 19th and 25th march 1991 the accused subhash was called at the police station several times for making enquiries.\nhe did not remember and was therefore not in a position to tell how many number of times the accused subhash was called for interrogation or making enquiries.\non seeing the case diary he stated that on 21 3 1991 the accused was definitely called twice on the same day though there is no mention of what enquiries were made from him.\nhowever the accused was not detained and was sent back.\nany person even if innocent and not connected in any way with a gruesome crime which had recently occurred and was talk of the town if called by police and interrogated as a suspect would be scared and be apprehensive of the likelihood of his being implicated in the crime.\nplaced in such situation if a villager unaware of the law happens to ask a person who he feels knows the things better than what he himself does as to what would be the period of incarceration to be suffered by any person for such an offence the impulse for inquiry may be outcome of a feeling of nervousness or mere inquisitiveness such an enquiry is not necessarily suggestive of the working of a criminal mind.\niii recovery of underwear stained with blood and semen strangely enough the underwear and baniyan though discovered and seized on an information given by the accused and on his pointing out apparently on a statement recorded under section 27 of the evidence act have not been produced and exhibited in the court.\nwhat happened to these clothes is not known.\nthere is not investigation directed towards finding out and no evidence worth its name collected and adduced in the court to show that the underwear and baniyan were of the accused.\ninsofar as baniyan is concerned it has no stains of any type on it and therefore its discovery and seizure is meaningless and irrelevant.\nso far as the underwear is concerned the investigation suffers from another infirmity also.\nblood sam ple of the accused was not collected and therefore not grouped.\nno evidence is available to show as to what was the blood group of the accused and therefore the possibility of blood on the underwear being of the accused himself can not be and is not ruled out.\nthe number and extent of spread of stains is also not known.\nshri sushil kumar jain the learned counsel for the accused appellant has placed reliance on shankarlal gyarasilal dixit v state of maharashtra air 1981.\nsc 765 1980 indlaw sc 47.\ntherein a charge under sections 376 and 302 ipc was sought to be substantiated on circumstanctial evidence.\none of the circumstan tial evidence relied on was that a human blood stain of b group was found on the accused 's pant which blood group was also of the deceased.\nanother circumstantial evidence relied on was that a stain of semen was found on the under pant of the accused.\nthis court held that the presence of blood stain of b group measuring 0 5 cm.\nin diameter on the appellant 's pant and of a dried stain of semen on his under pant were circumstances for too feeble to establish that the appellant raped or murdered the victim.\nb group is not uncommon group of blood and no effort was made to exclude the possibility that the blood of the accused belonged to the same group.\nas regards the dried stain of semen on the appellant 's under pant the court observed that the accused was a grown up man of 30 years and no compelling inference could arise that the stain was caused during the course of the sexual assault committed by him on the victim girl.\nin the present case the age of the accused was about 21 years at the time of the incident.\non his arrest he was subjected to medical examination and found to be a potent and capable person.\npresence of semen stain on underwear assuming that the underwear belonged to the accused though there is no evidence adduced in this regard is not by itself an incriminating piece of evidence connecting the accused with the crime in question.\nso also the discov ery of b group blood stain on the underwear can not be treated as an incrimi nating piece of evidence against the accused connecting him with the crime because there is no evidence that the underwear belonged to the accused and further the possiblity of the underwear being stained with the blood of the person to whom it belonged or the accused if he was wearing it has not been ruled out.\nfalse plea of alibi.\nthe high court has gone completely amiss in holding that a plea of alibi was taken by the accused and that was found to be false.\nthe accused has not stated during his statement under section 313 cr.\np c and nowhere suggested during cross examination of prosecution witnesses that at the time of the incident he was at a place wherefrom he could not have reached the place of the offence on the date and at the time of its commission.\nalthough the dead body of the victim was found on the outskirts of the village however there is no material available on record to fix the place and the likely time at which rape was committed on s and then she was murdered.\nwhat is being treated as the plea of alibi by the trial court and the high court is this.\nthe accused appears to have been engaged as a causal not regular gate keeper at hira moti a local talkies.\nthe proprietor of the cinema hall was examined to state that on 18th and 19th march the accused had taken leave from his job and during those days he was not present on duty.\nthis piece of evidence was put to the accused during his statement under section 313 cr.\np c and in reply he stated galat hai not correct.\nthe purpose of asking questions during examination under section 313 cr.\np c is to afford the accused personally an opportunity of explaining any incriminating circumstance so appearing in evidence against him.\nthe accused may or may not avail the opportunity for offering his explanation.\nthe accused did not avail the opportunity and stood short by simply stating that the statement of cinema owner was not correct.\nliteral meaning of alibi is elsewhere.\nin law this term is used to express that defence in a criminal prosecution where the party accused in order to prove that he could not have committed the crime charged against him offers evidence that he was in a different place at that time.\nthe plea taken should be capable of meaning that having regard to the time and place when and where he is alleged to have committed the offence he could not have been present.\nthe plea of alibi postulates the physical impossibility of the presence of the accused at the scene of offence by reason of his presence at another place.\nsee law lexicon p ramnath iyer second edition p 87.\ndenial by an accused of an assertion made by his employer that the accused was on leave of absence from duty on the date of offence does not by any stretch of reasoning or logic amount to pleading alibi.\nwe are clearly of the opinion that the accused appellant has not taken a plea of alibi and therefore the question of finding it false and then drawing an inference adverse to him does not arise at all.\nv absconding of the accused was the accused absconding at all.\ngrave injustice has been done to the accused by holding it as a fact that the accused was absconding after the date of the incident and then treating the so called absconding as a piece of incrimi nating circumstantial evidence against the accused.\naccording to harish chand sharma the accused was arrested on 3 4 1991 vide exbt.\np21 at behror which is a place situated at a distance of about 30 35 kms.\nfrom village kotputli where the incident had taken place.\nthough the accused is alleged to have been arrested at behror but the memo of arrest was not prepared at behror it was prepared at village kotputli.\nthe memo of arrest does not state the arrest of accused having been made at behror.\nif the accused was arrested at behror there is no reason why the memo of arrest should not have been prepared at village behror.\nat least this fact should have been mentioned in the memo of arrest even if the same was prepared at village kotputli.\nsecondly harish chand sharma himself states that between 19 3 1991 and 25 3 1991 the ac cused was called several times at the police station and on 21 3 1991 itself he was called twice in a day.\nthus he was always available to the police.\nkalu ram pw5 accompanied by a friend santosh pw9 had gone to see a movie in cinema talkies heera moti two days after the date of the incident and there the accused was present on his duty.\nthere is no evidence adduced by the prosecution to hold that soon after the date of the offence the accused was found missing from his residence or the place of his employment and was not available though searched at the place or places where normally he ought to have been.\nhence it could not have been held that the accused was absconding.\nconclusion.\nthus none of the pieces of evidence relied on as incriminating by the trial court and the high court can be treated as incriminating pieces of circumstantial evidence against the accused.\nthough the offence is gruesome and revolts the human conscience but an accused can be convicted only on legal evidence and if only a chain of circumstantial evidence has been so forged as to rule out the possibility of any other reasonable hypothesis excepting the guilt of the accused.\nin shankarlal gyarasilal dixit 's case 1980 indlaw sc 47 supra this court cautioned human nature is too willing when faced with brutal crimes to spin stories out of strong suspicions.\nthis court has held time and again that between may be true and must be true there is a long distance to travel which must be covered by clear cogent and unimpeachable evidence by the prosecu tion before an accused is condemned a convict.\nthe trial court and the high court have proceeded on an assumption of availability of five pieces forging links in the chain of circumstantial evi dence out of which we have found as stated hereinabove four of the alleged circumstances not to be pieces of incriminating circumstantial evidence at all.\nwe are left with circumstance No 3 only i e recovery of underwear and baniyan stained with semen and human blood group b which alone in the fact and circumstances of the case discussed hereinabove can not form basis of conviction of the accused appellant for the offence charged.\nbefore parting with the case we would like to place on record an observation of ours touching an aspect of the case.\nthere are clueless crimes committed.\nthe factum of a cognizable crime having been committed is known but neither the identity of the accused is disclosed nor is there any indication available of the witnesses who would be able to furnish useful and relevant evidence.\nsuch offences put to test the wits of an investigating officer.\na vigilant investigating officer well versed with the techniques of the job is in a position to collect the threads of evidence finding out the path which leads to the culprit.\nthe ends which the administration of cirminal justice serves are not achieved merely by catching hold of the culprit.\nthe accusation has to be proved to hilt in a court of law.\nthe evidence of investigating officer given in the court should have a rhythm explaining step by step how the investigation proceeded leading to detection of the offender and collection of evidence against him.\nthis is necessary to exclude the likelihood of any innocent having been picked up and branded as culprit and then the gravity of the offence arousing human sympathy persuading the mind to be carried away by doubtful or dubious circumstances treating them as of beyond doubt evidentiary value.\nthe appeals are allowed.\nconviction of the accused appellant under sections 302 and 3762f of indian penal code is set aside.\nhe is acquitted of the charges framed against him.\nhe shall be set at liberty forthwith if not required to be detained in connection with any other offence.\nappeals allowed.",

        "text": "section 120 b provides that whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with death imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term of two years or upwards shall be punishable in the same manner as if he has abetted such offence unless there was an express provision in the code for the punishment of such conspiracy. the first charge is in respect of the conspiracy alleged to have been entered into by the two respondents k vs ramana the approver and others known and unknown to commit criminal breach of trust of the funds of vesco and in order to screen its detection to falsify the accounts of vesco and to use forged documents as genuine. on the face of it this is a valid charge. but certain objections have been taken to it with which the court will deal at the appropriate place. the second charge is for an offence of criminal breach of trust punishable under section 409 and the accusation therein is that the two respondents along with ramana misappropriated 69 items aggregating to a little over rs 3 20 000. it is clear from the charge that some of the amounts were misappropriated between april 1947 and march 1950 some between april 1947 and march 1949 some between april 1947 and march 1951 and quite a large number between september 1947 and march 1950 and a still large number between april 1951 and march 1952. it is thus apparent that offences committed within a space of 12 months were tried along with offences committed beyond that period. unless therefore the provisions of section 239 are applicable it would follow that there was a misjoinder of charges. the third charge is that the two respondents along with the approver ramana made false entries on seven different dates in the account books between september 19 1947 and march 18 1952 and thus committed an offence under section 477 a i p c. the fourth charge is that the two respondents along with the approver ramana forged six documents on different dates between march 28 1949 and november 12 1951 and thus committed an offence under section 471 read with section 467 i p c. there the learned judges have held that these clauses are mutually exclusive and they can not be simultaneously applied and to construe them as supplementing each other would be enlarging the scope of the exceptions. each clause is an exception to the general rule enacted in section 233 cr p c. if such a combination is permissible all persons accused of offences described in cls a to g can be tried together in one case which certainly involves a bewildering multiplicity of charges and which would obviously set at naught the salutary principle contained in section 233. s 236 is a special provision available in case of doubt and is neither subject to the limitations prescribed by section 233 nor those of the other preceding provisions. now if the respondent no 1 were alone tried upon the second third and the fourth charges the provisions of section 2351 could have been pressed in aid if the allegations were that the offences were so connected together as to form one and the same transaction and the validity of the trial would not have been open to any attack. similarly if the second respondent were alone tried on the second charge his trial would not have been open to any objection if the allegation were that the offences were so connected together as to form the same transaction. here however the court a case where the prosecution alleges that there was additionally a conspiracy to which apart from the two respondents the approver and some other persons were parties and where in both the respondents were tried together. a conspiracy must be regarded as one transaction and therefore a single individual charged with it could be tried with the aid of section 2351 for all the acts committed by him in furtherance or in pursuance of the conspiracy without the limitations imposed by s 2341. the only provision in the code which permits the joint trial of more than one person is section 239 and what the court to see is whether under that provision the two respondents could have been jointly tried for the offences with which they were charged. on the other hand at the end of cl f there is a conjunction and. now since section 2341 can not be properly read overriding section 2351 there is no valid reason for construing it as overriding the provisions of section 239 either. s 239 must be read at least subject to sections 2341 and 2351 on the ground that if there are certain restrictions with respect to the trial of a single accused there is no reason why those restrictions will disappear if an accused person is tried along with several other persons. thus where several persons are accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed by them jointly within a period of 12 months the number of offences for which they could be tried can not exceed three. in this connection he relied upon the words within the meaning of section 224 occurring in cl c of section 239. these words clearly show that cl c of section 239 is subject to the provisions of section 234. in the courtâ€ ™ s opinion the words within the meaning of section 234 indicate that what was meant by the words offence of the same kind persons accused of more offences than one of the same kind not exceeding three in numberor may have used the words person accused of more than one offence of the same kind to the extent permissible under section 234. therefore even if the expression same transaction alone had been used in section 2351 it would have meant a transaction consisting either of a single act or of a series of connected acts. the expression same transaction occurring in cls a c and d of section 239 as well as that occurring in section 2351 ought to be given the same meaning according to the normal rule of construction of statutes. looking at the matter in that way it is pointless to inquire further whether the provisions of section 239 are subject to those of section 2361. the provisions of sub section 2 and 3 of section 235 are enabling provisions and quite plainly can have no overriding effect. but it would be open to the court to resort to those provisions even in the case of a joint trial of several persons permissible under section 239 s 236 is also an enabling provision to be availed of in case of doubt and it is meaningless to say that section 239 is subject to section 236. bearing in mind the fact that the provisions in the former part of chapter xix are applicable to charges made with the aid of section 239 only so far as may be it would not be right to construe section 239 as being subject to the provisions of sections 233 to 236. the court could not however give the expression such a restricted meaning. for even in the absence of those words the earlier provisions could not have been ignored. for it is a rule of construction that all the provisions of a statute are to be read together and given effect to and that it is therefore the duty of the court to construe a statute harmoniously. thus while it is clear that the sections preceding section 239 have no overriding effect on that section the courts are not to ignore them but apply such of them as can be applied without detracting from the provisions of s 239. indeed the very expression so far as may be emphasises the fact that while the earlier provisions have to be borne in mind by the court while applying section 239 it is not those provisions but the latter which is to have an overriding effect. criminal conspiracy as defined in section 120 a and consists of an agreement to do an illegal act or an agreement to do an act which is not illegal by illegal means. criminal conspiracy was however not an unknown thing before the amendment of the indian penal code in 1913. but what the amendment did was to make that conspiracy itself punishable the idea was to prevent the commission of crimes by so to speak nipping them in the bud. but it does not follow that where crimes have been committed the liability to punishment already incurred under section 120 b by having entered into a criminal conspiracy is thereby wiped away. no doubt as already stated where offences for committing which a conspiracy was entered into have actually been committed it may not in the particular circumstances of a case be desirable to charge the offender both with the conspiracy and the offences committed in pursuance of that conspiracy. but that would be a matter ultimately within the discretion of the court before which the trial takes place. in so far as the fourth point is concerned that would have a bearing not on the form of the charge but on the credibility of the evidence bearing on the point of conspiracy. the prosecution be established by reference to section 34 of the indian evidence act which reads thus as what it does is to make entries in books of account regularly kept in the course of business relevant in all proceedings in a court of law. these entries are however not by themselves sufficient to charge any person with liability. therefore when a sues b for a sum of money it is open to him to put his account books in evidence provided they are regularly kept in the course of business and show by reference to them that the amount claimed by him is debited against b. the entry though made by a in his own account books and though it is in his own favour is a piece of evidence which the court may take into consideration for the purpose of determining whether the amount referred to therein was in fact paid by a to b. the entry by itself is of no help to a in his claim against b but it can be considered by the court along with the evidence of a for drawing the conclusion that the amount was paid by a to b. to this limited extent entries in the account books are relevant and can be proved section 34 does not go beyond that. it says nothing about non existence of entries in account books. the court therefore agree with the high court that the account books of the various concerns to whom payments are said to have been made by the respondents are not by themselves evidence of the fact that no payments were received by them. the decision in queen empress vs grees chunder banerjee 1884 i l r 10 cal 1024 upon which reliance is placed by the high court in support of its view is also to that effect similarly in ram prashad singh vs lakhpati koer 1902 i l r 30 cal 231 247. lord robertson during the course of the hearing has observed that no inference can be drawn from the absence of any entry relating to any particular matter which observation supports the view taken in queen empress vs girish chander banerjee 1884 i l r 10 c l 1024. there is section ii of the evidence act which provides that facts not otherwise relevant are relevant if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact. some of the facts in issue in this case are whether payments of certain sums of money were made to crompton engineering co and other firms or authorities. absence of entries in their account books would be inconsistent with the receipt of the accounts and would thus be a relevant fact which can be proved under section 11. the fact that no payments were received by those firms has been deposed to by persons connected with those firms and whose duty it was to receive and acknowledge amounts received by the firms or who were in charge of the accounts of these firms. for the purpose of showing that no amounts were received by the firms their account books would thus be as relevant as the vesco account books for the purpose of showing the contrary. there is section 5 of the evidence act which reads thus as it is the case of the prosecution that the alleged payments were never made by vesco to the various firms. the offence under section 467 read with section 471 is punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment of either description for a period of 10 years but it is exclusively triable by a court of session. as regards the offence under section 477 a it is one of those sections which are specifically enumerated in section 337 1 and the argument advanced before the court and which the court rejected would not even be available with regard to the pardon in respect of that offence. it is true that the respondent no i alone was convicted by the additional sessions judge of this offence and the offence under section 467 read with section 471 but the validity of a pardon is to be determined with reference to the offence alleged against the approver alone and not with reference to the offence or offences for which his associates were ultimately convicted. the decision in sarwan singh vs the state of punjab 1957 b c r 953 on which reliance has been placed by the high court has been explained by this court in the case of maj e g barsay vs the state of bombay. this court has pointed out in the latter decision that while it must be shown that the approver is a witness of truth the evidence adduced in a case can not be considered in compartments and that even for judging the credibility of the approver the evidence led to corroborate him in material particulars would be relevant for consideration. the high court should bear this in mind for deciding whether the evidence of the approver should be acted upon or not. then again it would not be sufficient for the high court to deal with the evidence in a general way. it would be necessary for it to consider for itself the evidence adduced by the prosecution on the specific charges and then to conclude whether those charges have been established or not. the prosecution would be well advised if instead of placing the evidence on each and every one of those large number of charges against the respondents it chooses to select a few charges under each head other than the head of conspiracy and concentrates on establishing those charges this would save public time and also serve the purpose of the prosecution. the court set aside the acquittal of the respondents and remit the appeal to the high court for decision on merits in the light of our observations.",

acquisition of their agricultural lands by the state of uttar pradesh for the construction of the district jail of shahjahanpur.\nthe appellants themselves are bhumidar with transferable rights and are residents of village murchha tehsil puwayan in the district of shahjahanpur uttar pradesh.\nthe state of uttar pradesh vide its office memorandum dated 25 10 2004 constituted a committee under the chairmanship of the honourable minister of revenue to suggest its recommendations for transfer of prisons situated in the congested areas of various districts.\nafter conducting its second and final meeting on 10th.\njanuary2005the said committee recommended to the state government the shifting of the district jails from congested areas to outside the city limits within the district.\nas per the schedule this shifting was to be done in two phases 1 st phase 1 district jail shahjahanpur 2 district jail azamgarh 3 district jail jaunpur and 4 district jail moradabad 2 nd phase 1 district jail badaun 2 district jail varanasi 3 district jail barielly and 4 district jail muzaffarnagar.\nthe existing district jail of shahjahanpur constructed in 1870was one of the oldest and required shifting to new premises.\nthe government case is that the district jail is located in a densely populated area of the city and is overcrowded housing as many as 1869 prisoners while having a capacity of only 511.\nthereafter the state government constituted a committee under the chairmanship of chief secretary government of u p vide office memorandum dated 12 9 2007 to evaluate and consider the shifting of prisons identified to be shifted in the first phase.\nprisons in the districts of lucknow moradabad were added to the list.\nthis committee was also to evaluate and recommend the means for modernisation of existing old prisons.\nin its meeting dated 10 10 2007 the committee recommended that a detailed project report dpr be prepared by the rajkiya nirman nigam and that acquisition of lands for shifting of the prisons be done on a priority basis.\nthese recommendations were accepted by the state government vide the approval of the cabinet dated 7 12 2007 following this decision the director general of prisons administration and reformsuttar pradesh vide letter dated 04 06 2008requested the district magistrate shahjahanpur to send all the relevant records to the state government for publication of notification u ss 41 and 17 of the land acquisition act1894 hereinafter the act the land suggested for such acquisition by the divisional land utility committee was.\none admeasuring 25 89 hectares 63 93 acres in village morchha tehsil puwayan in the district of shahjahanpur.\nthereafter the district magistrate shahjahanpur forwarded the proposal to the commissioner and director directorate of land acquisition revenue board uttar pradeshfor the issuance of notifications u ss 41 and 17 of the act which in turn approved of it and further forwarded the recommendation to the state government vide letter dated 2 07 2008.\nthus the state government issued notifications u ss 41 and 17 on 21 08 2008.\nhowever the provisions of section 5a inquiry were dispensed with.\nthe state government explained that this was done in view of the pressing urgency in the matter of construction of the jails.\nbeing aggrieved by the aforesaid notifications the appellants moved a writ petition before the high court u art 226 of the constitution of india.\nthe high court in its decision dated 25 11 2009 refused to interfere with the selection of the site for the construction of the jail premises on the ground that it was not required to do so unless it found the selection of the site was wholly arbitrary.\nthe high court also approved the invoking of emergency provisions u s 17 of the act as per the guidelines given in essco fabs private limited and another vs state of haryana and another.\n2 scc 377 2008 indlaw sc 2494 having thus stated the high court dismissed the writ petition.\nbefore this court the appellants broadly raised the following arguments 1 whether or not the state government was justified in acquiring the said pieces of fertile agricultural land when there were alternative sites of unfertile banjar land available.\n2 whether or not the state government was justified in dispensing with the inquiry which is mandated to be conducted under section 5a of the act especially when one year elapsed between the notifications u s 4 and the one u s 6 they further stated that the high court had erred insofar as it upheld the factum of urgency in the absence of a categorical finding an enquiry under section 5a would have been detrimental to public interest.\nit was urged that it was clear from the counter of the respondent that the contemplation of a new prison was under consideration of the state government for several years.\ncommittee was formed matter was discussed at a leisurely pace at various levels and there is no material fact to justify the abridgement of the appellants right of raising an objection to acquisition and of a hearing under section 5a of the act.\nthis court finds a lot of substance in the contentions of the appellants.\nin connection with land acquisition proceeding whenever the provision of s 17 and its various sub sections including s 174 is used in the name of taking urgent or emergent action and the right of hearing of the land holder under section 5a is dispensed with the court is called upon to consider a few fundamentals in the exercise of such powers.\nadmittedly the land acquisition act a pre constitutional legislation of colonial vintage is a drastic law being expropriatory in nature as it confers on the state a power which affects person 's property right.\neven though right to property is no longer fundamental and was never a natural right and is acquired on a concession by the state it has to be accepted that without right to some property other rights become illusory.\nthis court is considering these questions especially in the context of some recent trends in land acquisition.\nthis court is of the opinion that the concept of public purpose in land acquisition has to be viewed from an angle which is consistent with the concept of a welfare state.\nthe concept of public purpose can not remain static for all time to come.\nthe concept even though sought to be defined u s 3f of the act is not capable of any precise definition.\nthe said definition having suffered several amendments has assumed the character of an inclusive one.\nit must be accepted that in construing public purpose a broad and overall view has to be taken and the focus must be on ensuring maximum benefit to the largest number of people.\nany attempt by the state to acquire land by promoting a public purpose to benefit a particular group of people or to serve any particular interest at the cost of the interest of a large section of people especially of the common people defeats the very concept of public purpose.\neven though the concept of public purpose was introduced by pre constitutional legislation its application must be consistent with the constitutional ethos and especially the chapter under fundamental rights and also the directive principles.\nin construing the concept of public purpose the mandate of art 13 of the constitution that any pre constitutional law can not in any way take away or abridge rights conferred under part iii must be kept in mind.\nby judicial interpretation the contents of these part iii rights are constantly expanded.\nthe meaning of public purpose in acquisition of land must be judged on the touchstone of this expanded view of part iii rights.\nthe open ended nature of our constitution needs a harmonious reconciliation between various competing principles and the overhanging shadows of socio economic reality in this country.\ntherefore the concept of public purpose on this broad horizon must also be read into the provisions of emergency power u s 17 with the consequential dispensation of right of hearing under section 5a of the said act.\nthe courts must examine these questions very carefully when little indians lose their small property in the name of mindless acquisition at the instance of the state.\nif public purpose can be satisfied by not rendering common man homeless and by exploring other avenues of acquisition the courts before sanctioning an acquisition must in exercise of its power of judicial review focus its attention on the concept of social and economic justice.\nwhile examining these questions of public importance the courts especially the higher courts cannot afford to act as mere umpires.\nin this context we reiterate the principle laid down by this court in authorised officer thanjavur and another vs s naganatha.\nayyar and others reported in 1979 3 scc 466 1979 indlaw sc 224wherein this court held it is true that judges are constitutional invigilators and statutory interpreters but they are also responsive and responsible to part iv of the constitution being one of the trinity of the nation 's appointed instrumentalities in the transformation of the socio economic order.\nthe judiciary in its sphere shares the revolutionary purpose of the constitutional order and when called upon to decode social legislation must be animated by a goal oriented approach.\nthis is part of the dynamics of statutory interpretation in the developing countries so that courts are not converted into rescue shelters for those who seek to defeat agrarian justice by cute transactions of many manifestations now so familiar in the country and illustrated by the several cases under appeal.\nthis caveat has become necessary because the judiciary is not a mere umpire as some assume but an activist catalyst in the constitutional scheme.\nin other words public purpose must be viewed through the prism of constitutional values as stated above.\nthe aforesaid principles in our jurisprudence compel this court to construe any expropriartory legislation like the land acquisition act very strictly.\nthe judicial pronouncements on this aspect are numerous only a few of them may be noted here.\nin dlf qutab enclave complex educational charitable trust vs state of haryana and ors 2003 5 scc 622 2003 indlaw sc 124this court construed the statute on town planning law and held expropriatory statute as is well known must be strictly construed.\nthe same principle has been reiterated subsequently by a three judge bench of this court in state of maharashtra and anr vs.\nb e billimoria and ors 2003 7 scc 336 2003 indlaw sc 618 in the context of ceiling law.\nthese principles again found support in the decision of this court in chairman indore vikas pradhikaran vs pure industrial coke and chemicals.\nltd and ors 2007.\n8 scc 705 2007 indlaw sc 554wherein this court construed the status of a person 's right to property after deletion of art 191f from part iii by referring to various international covenants namely the declaration of human and civil rights this court held that even though right to property has ceased to be a fundamental right but it would however be given an express recognition as a legal right and also as a human right.\nwhile discussing the ambit and extent of property right this court reiterated that expropriatory legislation must be given strict construction.\nin the background of the aforesaid discussion this court proceeds to examine the scope of a person 's right under section 5a of the act.\ninitially section 5a was not there in the land acquisition act1894 but the same was inserted long ago by the land acquisition amendment act1923 vide s 3 of act 38 of 1923.\nthe history behind insertion of section 5a in the act of 1894 seems to be a decision of the division bench of calcutta high court in j e d ezra vs the secretary of state for india and ors reported in 7 c w n 249 in that case the properties of ezra were sought to be acquired under the pre amended provision of the act for expansion of the offices of the bank of bengal.\nin challenging the said acquisition it was argued that the person whose property is going to be taken away should be allowed a hearing on the principles of natural justice.\nhowever the judges found that there was no such provision in the act.\nin order to remedy this shortcoming in the act of 1894an amendment by way of incorporation of section 5a was introduced on 11th july1923 the statement of objects and reasons for the said amendment is as follows the land acquisition act i of 1894 does not provide that persons having an interest in land which it is proposed to acquire shall have the right of objecting to such acquisition nor is government bound to enquire into and consider any objections that may reach them.\nthe object of this bill is to provide that a local government shall not declare u s 6 of the act that any land is needed for a public purpose unless time has been allowed after the notification u s 4 for persons interested in the land to put in objections and for such objections to be considered by the local government.\ngazette of india pt.\nv dated 14th july1923.\nthe said amendment was assented to by the governor general on 5th august1923 and came into force on 1st january1924.\nthe importance and scheme of section 5a was construed by this court in several cases.\nas early as in 1964this court in nandeshwar prasad and ors vs.\nu p government and ors.\nair 1964 sc 1217 1963 indlaw sc 141 speaking through justice k n wanchoo as his lordship then was.\nthe right to file objections under section 5a is a substantial right when a person 's property is being threatened with acquisition and we can not accept that that right can be taken away as if by a side wind.\nin that case the court was considering the importance of rights under section 5a vis vis s 171 and s 171.\na of the act.\nthe same view has been reiterated by another three judge bench decision of this court in munshi singh and ors.\nunion of india 1973 2 scc 337 1972 indlaw sc 176 in para 17 of the report this court held that section 5a embodies a very just and wholesome principle of giving proper and reasonable opportunity to a land loser of persuading the authorities that his property should not be acquired.\nthis court made it clear that declaration u s 6 has to be made only after the appropriate government is satisfied on a consideration of the report made by the collector under section 5a the court however made it clear that only in a case of real urgency the provision of section 5a can be dispensed with.\nin hindustan petroleum corporation limited vs darius shahpur chennai and ors.\n2005 7 scc 627 2005 indlaw sc 578this court held that the right which is conferred under section 5a has to be read considering the provisions of article 300 a of the constitution and so construed the right under section 5a should be interpreted as being akin to a fundamental right.\nthis court held that the same being the legal position the procedures which have been laid down for depriving a person of the said right must be strictly complied with.\nin a recent judgment of this court in essco fabs 2008 indlaw sc 2494 supra2009 2 scc 377this court after considering previous judgments as also the provisions of s 17 of the act held whereas sub s 1 of s 17 deals with cases of urgencysub s 2 of the said section covers cases of sudden change in the channel of any navigable river or other unforeseen emergency.\nbut even in such cases i e cases of urgency or unforeseen emergencyenquiry contemplated by section 5 a can not ipso facto be dispensed with which is clear from sub s 4 of s 17 of the act.\nthis court therefore held that once a case is covered under sub s 1 or 2 of section 17sub s 4 of s 17 would not necessarily apply.\nin our opinion therefore the contention of learned counsel for the respondent authorities is not well founded and can not be upheld that once a case is covered by sub ss 1 or 2 of s 17 of the act sub s 4 of s 17 would necessarily apply and there is no question of holding inquiry or hearing objections under section 5 a of the act.\nacceptance of such contention or upholding of this argument will make sub s 4 of s 17 totally otiose redundant and nugatory.\nthis court also held that in view of the ratio in union of india vs mukesh hans2004 8 scc 14 2004 indlaw sc 1413sub s 4 of s 17 can not be pressed into service by officers who are negligent and lethargic in initiating acquisition proceedings.\nthe question is whether in the admitted facts of this case invoking the urgency clause u s 17 4 is justified.\nin the writ petition before the high court the petitioners have given the details of the land holding and it has also been stated that the entire holding of petitioners 25791011 and 13 have been acquired and as a result of such acquisition the petitioners have become landless.\nfrom the various facts disclosed in the said affidavit it appears that the matter was initiated by the government 's letter dated 4th of june2008 for issuance of s 41 and s 17 notifications.\na meeting for selection of the suitable site for construction was held on 27th june2008and the proposal for such acquisition and construction was sent to the director land acquisition on 2nd of july2008 this was in turn forwarded to the state government by the director on 22nd of july2008 after due consideration of the forwarded proposal and documents the state government issued the s 4 notification along with s 17 notification on 21st of august2008 these notifications were published in local newspapers on 24th of september2008.\nthereafter over a period of 9 months the state government deposited 10 of compensation payable to the landowners along with 10 of acquisition expenses and 70 of cost of acquisition was deposited and the proposal for issuance of s 6 declaration was sent to the director land acquisition on 19th of june2009 the director in turn forwarded all these to the state government on 17th july2009and the state government finally issued the s 6 declaration on 10th of august2009 this declaration was published in the local dailies on 17th of august2009.\nthus the time which elapsed between publication of s 41 and s 17 notifications and s 6 declaration in the local newspapers is of 11 months and 23 days i e almost one year.\nthis slow pace at which the government machinery had functioned in processing the acquisition clearly evinces that there was no urgency for acquiring the land so as to warrant invoking s 17 4 of the act.\nin paragraph 15 of the writ petition it has been clearly stated that there was a time gap of more than 11 months between s 4 and s 6 notifications which demonstrates that there was no urgency in the state action which could deny the petitioners their right under section 5a in the counter which was filed in this case by the state before the high court it was not disputed that the time gap between s 4 notification read with section 17and s 6 notification was about 11 months.\nthe construction of jail is certainly in public interest and for such construction land may be acquired.\nbut such acquisition can be made only by strictly following the mandate of the said act.\nin the facts of this case such acquisition can not be made by invoking emergency provisions of s 17 if so advised government can initiate acquisition proceeding by following the provision of section 5a of the act and in accordance with law.\nfor the reasons aforesaid we hold that the state government was not justified in the facts of this case to invoke the emergency provision of s 174 of the act.\nthe valuable right of the appellants under section 5a of the act can not flatten and steamrolled on the ipsi dixit of the executive authority.\nthe impugned notifications u ss 4 and 6 of the act in so far as they relate to the appellants land are quashed.\nthe possession of the appellants in respect of their land can not be interfered with except in accordance with law.\nthe appeals are allowed.\nno order as to costs.\nappeals allowed.",

        "text": "in connection with land acquisition proceeding whenever the provision of s 17 and its various sub sections including s 174 is used in the name of taking urgent or emergent action and the right of hearing of the land holder under section 5a is dispensed with the court is called upon to consider a few fundamentals in the exercise of such powers. the concept of public purpose in land acquisition has to be viewed from an angle which is consistent with the concept of a welfare state. the concept of public purpose can not remain static for all time to come. the concept even though sought to be defined u s 3f of the act is not capable of any precise definition. the said definition having suffered several amendments has assumed the character of an inclusive one. it must be accepted that in construing public purpose a broad and overall view has to be taken and the focus must be on ensuring maximum benefit to the largest number of people. any attempt by the state to acquire land by promoting a public purpose to benefit a particular group of people or to serve any particular interest at the cost of the interest of a large section of people especially of the common people defeats the very concept of public purpose. even though the concept of public purpose was introduced by pre constitutional legislation its application must be consistent with the constitutional ethos and especially the chapter under fundamental rights and also the directive principles. the mandate of art 13 of the constitution that any pre constitutional law can not in any way take away or abridge rights conferred under part iii must be kept in mind. by judicial interpretation the contents of these part iii rights are constantly expanded. the meaning of public purpose in acquisition of land must be judged on the touchstone of this expanded view of part iii rights. the courts must examine these questions very carefully when little indians lose their small property in the name of mindless acquisition at the instance of the state. if public purpose can be satisfied by not rendering common man homeless and by exploring other avenues of acquisition the courts before sanctioning an acquisition must in exercise of its power of judicial review focus its attention on the concept of social and economic justice. while examining these questions of public importance the courts especially the higher courts cannot afford to act as mere umpires. the construction of jail is certainly in public interest and for such construction land may be acquired. but such acquisition can be made only by strictly following the mandate of the said act. in the facts of this case such acquisition can not be made by invoking emergency provisions of s 17. if so advised government can initiate acquisition proceeding by following the provision of section 5a of the act and in accordance with law.",

        "text": "the high court has not afforded to the appellant an opportunity to file counter affidavit. the high court while passing the impugned order and judgment did not take into consideration that the accused respondent has been convicted in another criminal case by the court of metropolitan magistrate patiala house new delhi. in the said case the accused has been convicted under sections 332461 of the dmc act and sentenced to six months simple imprisonment with fine of rs 5000. there was no good reason for letting the respondent off by granting to him the said benefit of pob act particularly keeping in view the large scale irregularity and unauthorized constructions carried by the builders in delhi despite strict direction of the municipal authorities and despite of the courts passing various orders from time to time against the unauthorized construction. the high court also failed to take into consideration that the respondent has been in jail for three days and had not put in substantial period in custody. in fact as could be seen from the annexures filed along with this appeal the respondent has been convicted for offence under sections 332 and 461 of the dmc act. since the appellant mcd was not given any opportunity by the high court to file conduct report of the respondent the order impugned in this appeal is liable to be set aside. the respondent did not also disclose the fact in the criminal revision filed before the high court that he has also been convicted in another criminal case. he would be guilty of playing fraud on the court as well as on the opposite party. a person whose case is based on falsehood can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the litigation. a litigant who approaches the court is bound to produce all documents which are relevant to the litigation. if he withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side then he would be guilty of playing fraud on the court as well on the opposite party. since the second respondent deliberately suppressed the crucial and important fact the court disapproved strongly and particularly the conduct of the second respondent and by reason of such conduct the second respondent disentitled himself from getting any relief or assistance from this court. the court however directed the second respondent to pay a sum of rs 10000 by way of cost to the appellant herein. the offender can only be released on probation of good conduct under this section when the court forms an opinion having considered the circumstances of the case the nature of the offence and the character of the offender that in a particular case the offender should be released on probation of good conduct. the second respondent is a previous convict as per the records placed before us. such a previous convict can not be released in view of section 4 of the pob act. the word shall in sub section 2 of section 4 is mandatory and the consideration of the report of the probationer officer is a condition precedent to the release of the accused as reported in the case of state v naguesh g shet govenkar and anr air 1970 goa 49 1969 indlaw goa 8 and a release without such a report would therefore be illegal. in the case of ram singh and ors v state of haryana1971 3 scc 914 1970 indlaw sc 513 it was observed that sections 4 and 6 of the act indicate the procedure requiring the court to call for a report from the probation officer and consideration of the report and any other information available relating to the character and physical and mental condition of the offender. these facts are of primary importance before the court can pass an order under the probation of offenders act. this plea can not be entertained in this court. since the high court has disposed of the criminal revision without giving an opportunity of filing counter affidavit to the counsel for the mcd and that the respondent did not disclose the fact in the criminal revision filed before the high court that he has also been convicted in another criminal case the judgment impugned in this appeal can not be allowed to stand. the court therefore had no hesitation in setting aside the order impugned and remit the matter to the high court for fresh disposal strictly in accordance with law.",

        "text": "the civil appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and decree rendered by a single judge of the gujarat high court. plaintiff filed the suit for redemption of the said mortgages in the year 1966. defendant 2brother of defendant i had been joined in that suit on the allegation that the latter was put in possession of mortgage properties by the former subsequent to the coming into existence of the mortgages. that suit was resisted by the defendants each of them having filed separate written statements which in sub stance did not differ from each other. the defence in those written statements was that defendant l and his family members had become tenants of the suit properties in the year 1959 1960 and had continued to be such tenants at the time of mortgage deeds executed in respect of those properties in the year 1961 and thereafter. it was also claimed therein that they had become owners of the said properties when the plaintiff in the year 1962 sold those properties to defendant 1 by receiving a sum of rs 4400 as consideration for the sale. the civil court notwithstanding the defence of the defendants recorded its findings. such findings were firstly that the defendants had failed to prove that the suit properties were sold in favour of defendant l subsequent to the giving of security of those properties in his favour under the mortgage deeds secondly that the defendants had failed to prove the past tenancy of the suit properties on its view that what was pleaded by them in the written statements was tenancy prior to the date of filing of the suit and thirdly that the mortgages of the suit properties were mortgages by conditional sale the defendants questioned the judgments and decrees of the trial court and the appellate court by filing a second appeal against the same in the high court of gujarat. the high court who heard the second appeal upheld the concurrent findings of the lower court.",
