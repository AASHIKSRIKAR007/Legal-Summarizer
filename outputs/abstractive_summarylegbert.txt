FACTS:
Tata Consultant Engineers, at its inception, was a partnership firm but subsequently the partnership was dissolved and in 1974 the undertaking became one of the divisions of Tata Sons Limited. Its work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen. Out of 665 employees at Bombay, the draftsmen and the administrative staff number 306.

JUDGMENT:
The original award was completed and signed by the Tribunal, and it cannot be reopened now except for the limited purpose of Rule 31. We, therefore, see no ground for quashing the order dated December 22, 1978 of the Tribunal. The Union prays the honourable Tribunal to clarify the position and correct the award accordingly"

ANALYSIS:
The Tribunal took into account the two principles involved in the process, the financial capacity of the industry to bear the burden of an increased wage bill, and the prevailing wage structure on an industry- cum-region basis. The particular character of the appellant, that it was a service industry and not a manufacturing concern, was taken into account.

ARGUMENT:
Wage scale statements were filed by the parties before the Tribunal pertaining to several engineering consultancy organisations. Reference was made to the political uncertainty in Iran which had placed an appreciable part of the appellant's business in jeopardy. It was pointed out that the dearness allowance and house rent allowance granted by the appellant made little impact in neutralising the cost of living.

STATUTE:
The application before the Tribunal was filed under Rule 31 of the Bombay Industrial Disputes Rules 1957. Rule 31 provides: "A Board, Court, Labour Court, Tribunal or Arbitrator may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any proceedings, report, award or as the case may be, decision"
